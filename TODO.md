# Faisal's TODO

Everything that needs a human with console access, a credit card, or a phone.
The agent cannot do any of these. Keep this current — it is the list Faisal
works from.

Phases 0 and 1 needed nothing from this list — `devSignIn` mints a
Google-provider identity in the Auth emulator, and the emulator handles password
resets. **Phase 3 is the first that genuinely blocks**, because signed URLs
cannot be minted against the emulator at all.

---

## ✅ Phase 3 setup — DONE (2026-07-22)

Kept for the record, because the ordering trap in step 3 is easy to hit again.
Signing was proven against the real project on 2026-07-22: a V4 URL streamed the
file and a short-TTL one was refused with `ExpiredToken`.

### 1. Create the Firebase project  ✅ done

1. <https://console.firebase.google.com> → **Add project**.
2. Project id: **`sabeel-class-recordings`** (or tell me what you chose and I
   will update `.firebaserc`). Disable Google Analytics — nothing uses it.
3. **Upgrade to the Blaze plan.** Cloud Functions require it. Expected spend is
   $0/month at this scale — see `docs/research/firebase-recording-costs.md` —
   but set a **budget alert at $5** anyway (Google Cloud console → Billing →
   Budgets & alerts) so a mistake surfaces as an email, not a bill.
4. Project settings → **Your apps** → add a **Web app**. Copy the config object
   and paste it over the placeholders in `app/src/firebase-config.ts`. It is not
   a secret — it ships in every client bundle.

### 2. Create the Storage bucket — region matters  ✅ done

Build → **Storage** → Get started → **location `us-central1`** (or `us-west1` /
`us-east1`; **only those three** carry the no-cost quotas). Take the modern
`*.firebasestorage.app` bucket, not a legacy `*.appspot.com` one — the legacy
rows cap downloads at 1 GB/day instead of 100 GB/month.

**This choice is permanent.** A bucket's location cannot be changed afterwards.

### 3. Enable the APIs FIRST — this creates the account you grant to  ✅ done

The service account that runs gen-2 functions,
`977423479850-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`, **does not exist on a
fresh Firebase project.** It is created when the Compute Engine API is enabled.
Granting before that fails with `NOT_FOUND: Unknown service account`, which
reads like an authentication problem and is not one. (Learned the hard way,
2026-07-22 — an earlier version of this file had these two steps the wrong way
round.)

```bash
gcloud services enable \
  compute.googleapis.com \
  cloudfunctions.googleapis.com \
  cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
  run.googleapis.com \
  artifactregistry.googleapis.com \
  eventarc.googleapis.com \
  iamcredentials.googleapis.com \
  --project=sabeel-class-recordings
```

Takes a minute or two. Confirm the account now exists before moving on:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts list --project=sabeel-class-recordings
```

### 4. Grant the signing permission  ✅ done

To sign a URL without a downloaded key file, the runtime service account has to
be allowed to **impersonate itself** through the IAM Credentials API
(`signBlob`). Gen-2 functions run as the **Compute Engine default** account, not
the App Engine `…@appspot.gserviceaccount.com` one most older tutorials name.

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
  977423479850-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \
  --member="serviceAccount:977423479850-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator" \
  --project=sabeel-class-recordings

# Confirm it took:
gcloud iam service-accounts get-iam-policy \
  977423479850-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com \
  --project=sabeel-class-recordings
```

**This is the failure that looks like working code.** Without it, signing throws
only in production; every local test passes. It is why the plan front-loads a
real deploy instead of trusting the emulator.

### 5. Wire it up  ✅ done

`firebase-config.ts` and `.firebaserc` point at the project.

---

## ✅ Auth setup — DONE (2026-07-22)

The ordering trap is kept for the record, because it is the thing that made this
confusing: the Google Cloud OAuth page showed only "Get started" because
**Firebase Authentication had never been initialized**, and enabling Google
sign-in *in Firebase* is what creates the OAuth client and the consent-screen
entry. Nothing on the GCP side was configurable before that, and
`disabledUserSignup` did not exist yet either, because it is a field of the same
config that did not exist.

Verified against the live Identity Toolkit config after Faisal's console work:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| `client.permissions.disabledUserSignup` | **must be `false`** — see below |
| Email/Password | enabled |
| Email link (passwordless) | disabled |
| Anonymous | disabled |
| `authorizedDomains` | `localhost`, `…firebaseapp.com`, `…web.app` |
| OAuth consent screen | External, **published** (not Testing) |

Redirect URIs and JavaScript origins registered for **both** `…web.app` and
`…firebaseapp.com`, so `authDomain` can be switched either way without further
console work. It now points at **`sabeel-class-recordings.web.app`**: Hosting
serves `/__/auth/*` itself, which keeps the sign-in redirect same-origin —
otherwise staff opening a link inside WhatsApp or Slack hit
`auth/missing-initial-state`, because those in-app webviews partition storage.

`WEB_CLIENT_ID` in `firebase-config.ts` is filled in from the created OAuth
client. It is not a secret; it ships in every client bundle.

### "Disable client-side sign-up" was WRONG advice — undo it

This file used to call that setting load-bearing. It is not usable at all, and
finding out cost a failed sign-in.

**`disabledUserSignup` blocks ALL client-side account creation — including a
staff member's first Google sign-in**, because creating their account *is* a
sign-up. It fails with `auth/admin-restricted-operation` before `onUserCreate`
ever runs; verified 2026-07-22, no user was created and the trigger logged
nothing. Staff self-onboarding and disabled sign-up are mutually exclusive, and
this app requires staff self-onboarding.

The protection it was meant to provide now lives in `provision.ts`, where it can
tell the two populations apart:

- A real student is created by `createStudent` **without a password**, so it has
  **no provider at all** when the trigger fires → left alone.
- Therefore anything that already has a `password` provider at creation came
  from the client SDK → **deleted**.

Proven both ways in `npm run test:e2e`: a self-signup's credential stops working
(`EMAIL_NOT_FOUND`), and reverting the rule makes that check fail.

---

## Still to do

### ✅ Phase 4 production walkthrough — DONE by the agent (2026-07-22)

Verified against the real project with temporary accounts (deleted after):
publish drove the **deployed `onRecordingWritten` trigger** to fan out an
assignment, a student marked complete (client write accepted, `completed=true`),
and a non-enrolled student's forge attempt was refused 403 — the self-only rule
holding in production. Nothing left for you here.

### ✅ 0–1 done (2026-07-22)

Sign-up re-enabled, you signed in, `onUserCreate` provisioned you as
`manager/pending`, `bootstrapAdmin` promoted you to `admin/active` and was then
**deleted** (URL 404s, and it can no longer be redeployed by accident — it is
exported only against the demo project).

You are the admin on <https://sabeel-class-recordings.web.app>.

### ✅ Sentry — DONE (2026-07-22)

Wired and live on all three surfaces. Web + native use the client DSNs in
gitignored `app/.env.local`; the **functions DSN was set as a Secret Manager
secret** (`SENTRY_DSN`) and the functions redeployed, so server reporting is now
active (secret bound to all 19 functions, verified by name). Reporting is off in
dev/debug bundles by design — events come only from deployed surfaces.

One small deferral, not blocking: **native source-map upload** (the Gradle
plugin needs a `prebuild`), so release APK stack traces are minified until
then; the errors still report. Web source maps upload on every hosting deploy
(`scripts/web-release.mjs`).

### 1. Nothing for the excused-only change

It needs no console work. The one data step, `scripts/migrate-excused-only.mjs`,
runs from the repo between the functions and hosting deploys — see
`docs/DEPLOY.md`. Worth knowing before it runs: it drops active obligations from
175 to roughly 49 on the current data, because being marked *absent* no longer
grants anything. Nothing is deleted; the rows stay for the ledger.

### ✅ 2. Notifications — DONE except one browser check (2026-08-15)

Cloud Messaging was already on, you generated the Web Push key pair, and the
public key is in `app/src/firebase-config.ts`.

**Android delivery is verified end to end**: the app registered an FCM token,
the Admin SDK sent to it against the live project, and the notification appeared
in the shade with the real copy. `npm run check:push` re-checks the send path
any time (valid VAPID key + FCM authenticating us as this project).

Still yours, once the web build is deployed:

- [ ] **Open the deployed site in a normal browser** and sign in. A browser that
      has never been asked now shows **Enable notifications** — on the home
      screen and on the **Notifications** screen. That is the expected state, not
      a fault: the app no longer asks on arrival, because a browser only honours
      a permission request raised straight from a click.

      Press it, allow it, and confirm the Notifications screen then reports the
      device as enabled. Seeing "this device can't show notifications" AFTER
      allowing is the real failure — it means permission was granted but no token
      could be obtained.

      Web push cannot be driven from here — Playwright's Chromium has no FCM
      credentials and branded Chrome under it refuses — so this is the one path
      with no automated check behind it.

### 3. Reword the password-reset email

Authentication → **Templates → Password reset**. One template serves two
journeys: a student receiving it for an account that has never had a password,
where the default "reset your password" reads as though something has gone
wrong, and a student who asked for it themselves from **More → Change
password**, where it is exactly right. Wording that covers both — "Set your
password for Sabeel Class Recordings" or similar — is what to aim for; there is
no way to send two different templates from one Firebase project.

### ✅ 4. Android app registered — DONE (2026-07-23)

Faisal registered the Android app (`com.sabeelinstitute.classrecordings`) with the
debug SHA-1 `5E:8F:16:06:2E:A3:CD:2C:4A:0D:54:78:76:BA:A6:F3:8C:AB:F6:25` and
downloaded `google-services.json`. It is wired in: the Google Services Gradle
plugin is applied, and the file lives at `app/android/app/google-services.json`
(and `app/google-services.json`), **gitignored** — regenerate it from the console
on a fresh clone or the Android build fails. A signed release APK was built,
verified against production (student sign-in + streaming) and shipped as a GitHub
Release. Staff Google sign-in on-device should now work; students already did.

Still for a PUBLIC release (Phase 9): a dedicated **release keystore** (the APK is
currently debug-signed) and **its** SHA-1 registered.

### 5. Not blocking anything

- ✅ **Institute timezone** — set to `America/Chicago` (Houston) in Phase 4.
- **App Check**: Play Integrity (Android) + reCAPTCHA Enterprise (web), plus
  **debug tokens** for the `tb_emu` AVD and local web — without those it locks
  out our own dev builds. Wired but not enforced until then.
- **A known residual on shared devices, for you to be aware of rather than
  act on.** A push token carries no proof of who holds the device, and no rule
  can invent one — any signed-in account may register any token string under
  its own id. `onDeviceRegistered` makes a token belong to the most recent
  registration, which is what stops one student's notifications arriving on the
  next student's phone after a sign-out that failed to unregister. The cost is
  that somebody who has personally used a shared device, and so has seen its
  token on their own record, could re-register it later and quietly stop
  delivery to whoever holds it now. It needs deliberate effort, it only reaches
  devices they have used, and nothing is disclosed — but if a classroom tablet
  ever stops receiving notifications for no apparent reason, this is the thing
  to remember. App Check (above) raises the bar; only a token bound to the
  device by the platform would close it.

### Confirm one behaviour: what re-enrolling restores

Nothing is broken here — the app, the manual and the ledger now all say the same
thing, which they did not before. Worth one look because it is a policy choice
rather than a bug.

Unenrolling a student turns their obligations in that class off, and now STAYS
off: a later edit to any session in the course used to switch them back on days
afterwards, which is fixed. Re-enrolling them restores those obligations the
next time anything touches that session — which is exactly what the manual and
the recording ledger promise on screen ("re-enrolling them or republishing
restores it"). An internal comment used to claim the opposite; it has been
corrected to match.

**The choice:** restoring is friendlier to a student who left and came back
mid-term — their term's listening picks up where it was. The alternative reading
of "accountability starts at enrolment" is that a returning student should only
be accountable for sessions marked after their return. The app does the first.
If you want the second, say so and it changes in one place.

### 5b. The no-account-creation gate — DONE (2026-09-07)

Nothing owed here; recorded so the next reader does not re-litigate it. The
Android app can no longer bring an account into existence: `accountExists`
verifies the Google token and `app/src/auth/google.ts` refuses before
`signInWithCredential`, which is the line that would create one. That is what
keeps Apple 5.1.1(v) and Play's deletion requirement disengaged, and it is worth
knowing it is load-bearing before anyone "simplifies" the sign-in path.

Two consequences to expect rather than treat as bugs:

- **A new colleague cannot sign in on the phone until they have signed in on the
  web once.** That is the design, not a defect. The instruction goes in the
  onboarding email — it must NOT go in the app, because naming an external
  sign-up route is Play's second trigger word for word.
- The refusal says "This account isn't set up for the app yet. Contact your
  administrator." and names no website, deliberately.

- [ ] **FAISAL — the one check nobody has run, and the store claim rests on it.**
      Tests cover the callable and the ordering; only a device covers the round
      trip. Kanban did the equivalent on 2026-08-18. On a phone, on the RELEASE
      build (production, not emulators):

      1. Tap **Sign in with Google** and pick a personal Google account that has
         no account in this project.
      2. Expect: *"This account isn't set up for the app yet. Contact your
         administrator."* — and no sign-in.
      3. Then the assertion that actually matters, checked in Firebase rather
         than inferred from the screen. **Ask about the exact address you used**
         — `auth/user-not-found` is the pass:

         ```sh
         ADDR=you@gmail.com node -e "const a=require('firebase-admin');\
         a.initializeApp({projectId:'sabeel-class-recordings'});\
         a.auth().getUserByEmail(process.env.ADDR)\
         .then(u=>{console.log('FAIL — an account exists:',u.uid,u.providerData.map(p=>p.providerId));process.exit(1)})\
         .catch(e=>{console.log(e.code==='auth/user-not-found'?'PASS — no account was created':'unexpected: '+e.code);process.exit(0)})"
         ```

         Do NOT check this by counting accounts on non-institute domains, which
         is the obvious thing and is wrong here: **students sign in with personal
         addresses**, so production legitimately holds gmail.com accounts (six as
         of 2026-09-07, all provider `password`). The sibling apps are staff-only
         and can use that shortcut; this one cannot. A stray Google sign-in would
         show up as an address carrying the **`google.com`** provider that is not
         on `oursabeel.com`.

      4. Then sign in with a Workspace account immediately afterwards and confirm
         it works — which also proves the Google account chooser was cleared, and
         that a person who picked the wrong account can still switch.

### 5c. KVM access can lapse without a reboot — one-time fix

`/dev/kvm` access on this machine comes from a login-session ACL, and on
2026-09-10 the device node was recreated without it: the ACL named only `sddm`,
the `kvm` group was empty, and the AVD refused hardware mode until a reboot
re-applied it. Make it not depend on the session:

- [ ] `sudo gpasswd -a $USER kvm` — then log out and in once.

### 6. The three static pages the stores need — BUILT (2026-09-07)

Done and tested; **one thing left, and it is yours.**

They live in `app/public/` (Expo copies that into the export verbatim) and
`firebase.json` rewrites `/privacy`, `/support` and `/get-app` to them **ahead of
the `**` catch-all** — behind it they would answer 200 with the app shell, which
is the silent way this breaks. `functions/test/unit/hostingPages.test.ts` guards
the ordering and that each destination exists; `npm run smoke:prod` fetches all
three from the deployed site anonymously and checks the body is the page rather
than the shell.

The host is the web app's own domain, `sabeel-class-recordings.web.app`. The
earlier guess, `recordings.oursabeel.com`, is attached to nothing, so the one
link a reviewer is guaranteed to follow led nowhere. `PRIVACY_URL` now matches
the rewrite, and a test asserts they agree.

- [ ] **FAISAL — create `privacy@oursabeel.com`.** All three pages name it as the
      address for deleting an account, asking what is held, and correcting it, and
      the policy promises a response within 30 days. It does not exist yet. Make
      it a Workspace group with **two** admins on it, so the policy does not go
      stale when one person changes role. This is the same address the sibling
      apps settled on (2026-08-18).
- [ ] **FAISAL — read the privacy policy.** It should be read by somebody who did
      not write it. It describes what this app actually does, but the claims about
      retention are the institute's to stand behind, not mine.

## Before Phase 6 (Zoom)

Design decisions (locked 2026-07-24): **one central Zoom user** hosts the class
recordings (not multiple hosts); **manual class mapping** (staff pick the target
class at import time — no auto-map by topic).

- [ ] **Create a Zoom Server-to-Server OAuth app** (internal/private, no
      Marketplace publication). Supply account id, client id, client secret — via
      `firebase functions:secrets:set ZOOM_ACCOUNT_ID` / `ZOOM_CLIENT_ID` /
      `ZOOM_CLIENT_SECRET`, never pasted into chat or a file.
- [ ] **Grant exactly these granular scopes** (`:admin`, NOT `:master` — this is
      a single-account S2S app; `:master` is only for master/sub-account ISVs):
      - `cloud_recording:read:list_user_recordings:admin` — list the central
        user's cloud recordings (the import picker; response already carries each
        file's download_url, type, duration, start time).
      - `cloud_recording:read:list_recording_files:admin` — read one meeting's
        recording files (per-recording import + retry via
        `GET /meetings/{meetingId}/recordings`).
      - `user:read:user:admin` — *recommended*, resolve/validate the central user
        by email at runtime instead of hardcoding an id.
      (Not needed unless we later add more hosts:
      `cloud_recording:read:list_account_recordings:admin`. No write scopes — we
      never modify anything in Zoom. Source: developers.zoom.us granular scopes.)
- [ ] **Enable audio-only recording** on that user (Settings → Recording →
      "Record an audio-only file" ON) so recordings produce an **M4A**
      (`recording_type: audio_only`). If existing recordings are video-only with
      no M4A, switch to audio-only going forward rather than building server-side
      ffmpeg extraction.
- [ ] **One real cloud recording with an M4A** on the account — needed only for
      the final "one real import" check; the whole job is built + emulator-tested
      against a fake Zoom first.

## Before Phase 9 (release)

- [ ] **Brand assets**: logo, app icon, splash. Phase 0 ships without them.
- [ ] **Android release keystore + its SHA-1** registered — the release key
      differs from the debug key and Google sign-in breaks without it.
- [ ] **Retention policy** decision. The brief says recordings are kept
      indefinitely; a GCS lifecycle rule is cheap to add but the policy is
      yours. Audio is affordable at any plausible bitrate — five years at
      128 kbps is roughly 96 GiB, about $2/month.

## Optional / whenever

### 7. A student is running the 0.3.0 APK, and nothing tells them to update

Sentry, 2026-09-08: `Missing or insufficient permissions` from
`studentRecordings` on a Samsung SM-S931U, release `0.3.0+19`, Katy TX. That
build lists a course's published recordings directly; the rules have refused
that to students since 2026-08-14, when a recording began opening on an active
assignment. The student sees an empty library and no reason, and the app has
no minimum-version check, so every rules change since has broken that phone
silently. Sentry attaches no identity by design, so the person cannot be named
from here.

- [ ] Tell students to install the current build from the download page. The
      staff who last signed in on 2026-09-10 (Israa, Khadija, Rukaiya) can pass
      it on.
- [ ] Decide whether the app should carry a **minimum build number** it reads
      from Firestore on launch and refuses to run below, with a message saying
      to update. Cheap to build (a `config` document, a rule to let signed-in
      users read it, one gate screen); it is the only way a future rules change
      cannot strand an old install again. Note for later store builds: a
      Play-distributed app may not point at a sideload page for the update, so
      the message would name Google Play once that exists — the document can
      carry the text.

### 8. Decisions from the 2026-09-11 review

Three taken on 2026-09-11 and shipped: every call re-checks the account behind
the token (a disabled account is refused at once); an archived course's
recordings move into a quiet Archived group on the student home; a student's
progress and completion writes need an ACTIVE grant. The empty-state item that
was left open here is done too: every list screen waits for its first snapshot
before it says "No … yet".

### 9. Decisions from the 2026-09-11 second round

Fixed and shipped in v0.6.4 without a decision: a retried "recording ready"
push no longer trusts its stale payload; a disabled account's device
registrations go with its session; a register submission removes no stored
mark; "not recorded" and a recording can no longer both be true; a
needs-attention Zoom import is always retryable; a revoked session says "sign
in again"; a tapped web push opens the app; archived and unpublished
recordings keep their ledger, with the rows as they stood when it closed; a
grant on a course archived with listening off reads "Closed", not "Listen
by"; the gate-screen poll cannot be carried by a previous sign-in; Play no
longer raises the notification prompt; a withdrawn recording is not reported
as a fault; four crash-in-the-middle states repair themselves. Left for you:

- [ ] **The release APK is signed with the public debug keystore.**
      `app/android/app/build.gradle` `release { signingConfig
      signingConfigs.debug }` — the certificate is `CN=Android Debug`, the
      SHA-1 registered with Firebase is the debug key's. Anyone with the
      Android SDK holds that key, so an APK carrying this package name could
      be built by anyone and would install OVER the real one as an update.
      For a sideloaded, private-institute app this is a known deferral (the
      note under item 4 above); before Play, or before the app is on any
      phone you do not control, it needs: a keystore generated and kept
      outside the repo (`keytool`, password in your password manager, the
      file backed up — losing it means no update path ever again), the
      release signing config reading it from the environment or a gitignored
      `keystore.properties`, ITS SHA-1 added in the Firebase console (Google
      sign-in breaks on the new key without it), and one round of
      uninstall/reinstall for every current install, since Android refuses an
      update signed with a different key. Say when, and whether now: it
      forces the reinstall on every staff phone.
- ✅ **An archived recording leaves the course totals — decided 2026-09-11.**
      Closing a term is archiving the COURSE, which keeps every count. Archiving
      or unpublishing one recording withdraws it from the course card, the
      attendance report and the per-student counts, as if it had never been
      required; its own ledger page keeps the rows. The manual says so in as
      many words (§2.6, §3.4), and no longer describes recording-archive as
      an end-of-term step.
- [ ] **Headphones unplugged keeps playing.** Android's convention is to pause
      when the output route disappears (`ACTION_AUDIO_BECOMING_NOISY`).
      expo-audio does not handle it; it needs a small native receiver, i.e. a
      native change in `android/`. Decide whether it matters before the first
      real-phone complaint.
- [ ] **A push arriving while the app is open shows nothing.** FCM's own
      banner appears only in the background; a foreground handler would have
      to render the message itself. Decide whether an in-app banner is worth
      building, or whether background delivery is enough for three messages a
      term.
- [ ] **The work queue never lets a "no recording yet" row go.** A session
      whose attendance is in but whose audio never arrived sits on Today for
      the life of the course — and once its listen-by date has gone, the
      upload it prompts leads to a Publish the server refuses. Options: retire
      the row at the listen-by date like the publish reminder does, or keep it
      and say "past its date — move the date, or mark it not recorded".
- [ ] **A completion written after the deadline counts.** The rules gate a
      student's completion on an ACTIVE grant, not on the date (the date
      lives in `getPlaybackUrl`; comparing it in rules would be a second copy
      of the maths). So a hand-built write after midnight, or an offline
      completion syncing the next morning, reads as complete everywhere.
      The second is by design; the first needs the SDK. If it ever matters,
      flag `completedAt > dueDate` on the ledger rather than dating the rules.
- [ ] Not decisions, noted for a quieter week: the reconcile is read-then-
      write outside a transaction (a register correction racing an unenrol
      can leave a grant on until the next write); publish and Remove audio
      can interleave into a published recording with no object. Both need a
      collision nobody has produced.
