/**
 * Routes reachable once signed in and active. Gate screens are not routes —
 * they replace the whole navigator, so a gated account cannot be deep-linked
 * past.
 *
 * EVERY PARAM IS AN ID OR A PLAIN STRING, and must stay that way. React
 * Navigation builds the browser URL from these with `String(value)`, so a
 * document param becomes literally `[object Object]` in the address bar and
 * comes back as that string on reload — which is why Back exited the site
 * instead of going anywhere until this was fixed (see the linking config in
 * App.tsx). Documents are resolved from these ids in the App.tsx wrappers,
 * live, which also means no screen can render from a frozen copy of something
 * it edits.
