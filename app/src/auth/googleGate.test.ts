/**
 * The ORDER of two calls, which is the whole store exemption.
 *
 * `signInWithCredential` is the line that brings an account into existence. The
 * claim made to Apple and Google is that this app never reaches it for an
 * identity that has no account — so what is asserted here is that the call did
 * not happen, not that a message was returned. A refusal shown on screen while
 * the credential exchange ran anyway would look correct to a person and be a
 * false declaration to a store.
 *
 * `GoogleSignin.signIn()` is pure Google OAuth and touches nothing in the
 * Firebase project, which is the only reason there is a window to check in.
 *
 * Mocked at the module boundary rather than run against emulators because the
 * native Google SDK cannot run here at all; the callable's own behaviour is
 * covered in `functions/test/integration/accountExists.integration.test.ts`.
