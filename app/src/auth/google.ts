 * for a Firebase credential — the same signInWithCredential path devSignIn
 * exercises, so everything downstream of the session is identical.
 *
 * Requires BOTH of these, or Google returns an opaque DEVELOPER_ERROR that looks
 * like a code bug and is not:
 *  - the debug/release SHA-1 registered on the Firebase Android app, with
 *    `google-services.json` RE-DOWNLOADED afterwards — the re-download is what
 *    adds the `client_type: 1` entry; adding the SHA-1 in the console does not
 *    update a file you already have;
 *  - `webClientId` set to the WEB client id (client_type: 3), not the Android one.

 * project — which is the only reason there is a window to check in.
 *
 * There is deliberately no sign-up affordance anywhere in this app, and the
 * refusal names no website. Both stores stop requiring in-app account deletion
 * only while the app neither creates an account nor points at somewhere that
 * does, and "sign in on the website first" is the second of those two triggers
 * stated almost verbatim. The real instruction belongs in the onboarding email,
 * out of band, where it does not count — at the cost of one support question per
 * new colleague. Read `sabeel-institute-kanban/docs/STORE-RELEASE.md` before
 * adding anything friendlier here.
 *
 * This file is the NATIVE half of the seam. `google.web.ts` is the web half and
 * keeps creating accounts, which is why nothing here has to detect a platform.
