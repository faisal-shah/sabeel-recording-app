 * screen is the only screen an unauthenticated screenshot can reach, and it
 * exercises almost none of the app — a green sign-in shot is not evidence about
 * any other screen.
 *
 * MUST NEVER APPEAR IN A PRODUCTION BUILD. Two independent conditions gate it,
 * because either alone could be got wrong: a release build carrying a stale
 * emulator env, or a dev build pointed at production. Before publishing, export
 * the web bundle and grep it for the dev-row label to confirm it is absent.

 * so a password-based dev path would be provisioned as a student — never
 * exercising the staff domain gate this is meant to test.
 *
 * Sign in with a non-org address and the auth trigger deletes the account,
