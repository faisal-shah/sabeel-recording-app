/**
 * The docked now-playing bar.
 *
 * This is the piece that makes app-wide playback VISIBLE, and it only became
 * possible once the session moved out of `PlayerScreen` (see `playback.ts`).
 * A two-hour lecture is not listened to in one sitting on one screen: people
 * check their attendance record, open another class, put the phone down. With
 * playback held by the app and this bar always showing what is loaded, leaving
 * the player screen stops being a decision.
 *
 * Two shapes, and the difference is not decoration:
 *
 *  - NARROW it sits directly on top of the tab bar as a single compact row —
 *    artwork-less: the title, back 15, play/pause and a dismiss. Skipping BACK
 *    earns its place on a phone even though skipping forward does not: the
 *    phone is where someone listens hands-free, and "I missed that sentence" is
 *    the reason anyone reaches for a bar they are not looking at. Scrubbing
 *    forward is a control you look at, and it is one tap away on the player.
 *  - WIDE it spans the content area beneath the rail with the transport laid
 *    out inline: back 15 · play/pause · forward 30, elapsed and remaining, and
 *    a full-width progress line. There is room for the controls, so putting
 *    them behind a tap would be hiding them for no reason.
 *
 * A progress line runs along the TOP edge in both, so the bar reports position
 * without spending a row on it.
