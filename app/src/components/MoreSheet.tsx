/**
 * Everything behind "More" — the tail of the navigation.
 *
 * RENDERED BY THE SHELL, not by the bar, and that is not tidiness. An overlay
 * is not part of the control that opens it, and keeping it here means the bar
 * and the rail can live at different places in the tree — which is what lets
 * the bar sit AFTER the content in reading order on a phone while the rail sits
 * before it on a wide screen. Held inside the bar, crossing the breakpoint
 * unmounted the sheet and threw away whatever was open.
 *
 * What belongs here is what you need occasionally rather than daily. A screen
 * visited twice in an account's life does not earn a permanent slot, however
 * often it gets proposed for one.
