// Native side of the error-reporting seam (web sibling: sentry.web.ts).

// Same discipline as web: report only from a non-dev bundle, so debug builds and
// Metro dev runs stay console-only and never pollute the production Sentry
// project. The DSN is a client value from app/.env.local, baked into the release
// bundle; absent, this is a silent console-only no-op.
//
// `@sentry/react-native` links a native module via RN autolinking (no prebuild
// needed for capture). Source-map upload — which needs a Sentry auth token and
// the Gradle plugin — is deferred; until then, release stack traces are
// minified but the errors do report.
