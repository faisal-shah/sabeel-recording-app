/**
 * How long a device-registration write is waited on before the caller moves on.

 * FIRESTORE DOES NOT SETTLE A WRITE UNTIL THE BACKEND ACKNOWLEDGES IT. On a
 * phone with no signal that is never — and both of the writes below were
 * awaited unbounded by callers that show a spinner meanwhile. Offline, "Enable
 * notifications" spun for ever on a device whose permission had just been
 * granted, and Sign out never reached `signOut(auth)` at all, leaving somebody
 * signed in on a shared device: the exact case that call exists to prevent.
 *
 * GIVING UP ON THE WAIT IS NOT GIVING UP ON THE WRITE — for the REGISTER. The
 * SDK keeps it queued and sends it when the connection returns, and nothing
 * drops the credential in between.
 *
 * IT IS FOR THE UNREGISTER, and that is deliberate rather than overlooked.
 * `signOut` calls it and then drops the credential four lines later, so a delete
 * that has not been acknowledged is abandoned on the previous account's queue
 * and never sent. Waiting for it instead is worse — offline the button never
 * returns, and the person stays signed in on a shared device, which is the case
 * the call exists to protect. So the client stops waiting, and the leak it
 * leaves is closed on the server: `onDeviceRegistered` removes a token from
 * every other account the moment it is registered to a new one. That also
 * covers the sign-out that never ran at all, which no client-side scheme can.
