 * Permission is asked on the BUTTON below, never on arrival. Opening a screen
 * is not a user gesture: the effect that runs on mount is a later task than the
 * tap that navigated here, so it carries no user activation, and Safari refuses
 * a permission request that far from a click — silently, leaving permission at
 * 'default' and the site in neither the allowed nor the blocked list. Mounting
 * therefore only registers a device that is ALREADY permitted, which needs no
 * gesture and keeps every working device working with no extra click.
 *
 * A device that cannot receive push says so rather than showing switches that
 * could never fire — an off switch and a switch with nothing behind it look
 * identical, and the second one is a lie.
