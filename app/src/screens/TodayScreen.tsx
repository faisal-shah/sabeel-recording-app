/**
 * The staff landing screen: what is waiting, most urgent first.
 *
 * The argument for leading with this rather than with the cohort hierarchy is
 * the shape of the job. Everything a teacher does here runs on a fixed cycle: a
 * class meets, attendance is taken, the recording is added and published, and a
 * week later access closes. Every one of those steps
 * is dated, every one has an owner, and every one is invisible until somebody
 * goes looking for it course by course. A hierarchy answers "where is X"; this
 * answers "what is waiting", which is the question actually being asked on a
 * Tuesday evening.
 *
 * Nothing here is stored — see `today.ts`. Each row is derived, live, from
 * documents the reader can already see, so it cannot go stale and there is no
 * second copy of the truth to reconcile. The count on the tab comes from the
 * same subscription, so the badge and this screen cannot disagree.
 *
 * An empty queue is a RESULT, not a blank screen: "nothing is waiting" is the
 * single most useful thing this screen can say, and it has to say it in those
 * words rather than showing an empty list.
