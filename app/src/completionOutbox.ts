// Native side of the completion-durability seam (web sibling:
// completionOutbox.web.ts).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS: on native the Firebase JS SDK has only a MEMORY cache (no
// IndexedDB — see firestoreInit.ts). A completion marked offline is queued in
// memory and flushes fine if the app stays open until reconnect — but a
// force-kill before reconnect loses it, and the student would reopen to find
// their completion silently reverted. That is exactly the "offline queue that
// never drains looks like one that works" failure the brief warns about.
//
// So on native, the completion STATE write goes through a small AsyncStorage
// outbox: record intent durably, fire the write, and remove the record only
// once the server acknowledges. On launch, whatever is still in the outbox is
// replayed. This is NOT a bespoke sync engine — it is a durability shim over the
// SAME direct Firestore write, idempotent because the completion doc id is
// deterministic (`${studentUid}_${recordingId}`).
//
// Only the current-state doc is outboxed. The append-only completionEvents are
// best-effort audit: a force-kill may drop one event, but the state — which
// carries `completedAt` — is preserved, and replaying events would duplicate
// them (they have generated ids).
