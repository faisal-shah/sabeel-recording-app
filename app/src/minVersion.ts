/**
 * Is this build too old to run?
 *
 * The institute's floor lives in `config/app` and is read live, before anyone
 * signs in — so a build retired while it is open lands on the update screen
 * at once, and one opened after the fact never gets as far as a sign-in the
 * rules would then refuse. The web has no floor: the site serves the current
 * bundle to everyone.
 *
 * NEVER LOCKS ANYONE OUT ON A READ THAT DID NOT ARRIVE. Offline, or before the
 * first snapshot, or with no document at all, the floor is unknown and the app
 * runs: a gate that closed on a network fault would shut out the people it is
 * meant to help. A refusal is treated the same way — the rule opens the
 * document to everyone, so one would be a deploy mistake, not a verdict.
