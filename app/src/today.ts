 * it describes, and no way for it to claim work that is already done: close the
 * gap and the row is gone.
 *
 * LIVE, not a one-shot read, and the badge is why. A count on the tab that is
 * refreshed only on arrival tells you two sessions are blocking access for as
 * long as you stay on the screen where you just fixed both — and a badge that
 * lies about work you have finished is worse than no badge. Two listeners hold
 * the whole thing honest: submit attendance and the row and the count go at the

   * this the landing screen sits on "Checking your courses…" with no way out.
   * The first guard in `buildTodayQueue` waits on `courses`, which comes from
   * `allCourses`/`myCourses`, so leaving those two out left exactly that.
   *
   * `useListenerFailed` matches on the label and ignores the scope, so an
   * unscoped denial of the same query from another screen counts here too. That
   * is the right answer — it is the same query against the same rules, and it
   * fails for both or neither — but it is not a claim about isolation: the
   * SCOPING exists so that a screen's success cannot clear the shell's failure,
   * which is the opposite direction.
   *
   * Spelled out rather than derived from the calls above, because
   * `firestoreIndexes.test.ts` parses `label:` out of every `useLiveQuery` call
   * site and a computed one is a call site it cannot read — a guard that stops
   * seeing a query is worse than the duplication.
