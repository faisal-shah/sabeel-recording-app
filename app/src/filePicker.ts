 * browser, the file is read into a Blob for the same Storage upload the web uses,
 * and its duration is read with expo-audio so a phone upload stores the SAME
 * `durationSec` a computer upload does. That matters: the player's scrubber,
 * remaining time and listened-% bar all read the stored duration, so a null one
 * would leave a phone-made recording playable but with a broken transport.
 *
 * (Autolinked; a native rebuild is needed after adding it, but no config plugin
 * so no prebuild.)
