/**
 * Semantic theme tokens. Every color in the app comes from here.
 *
 * SINGLE LIGHT THEME — no dark mode (decided 2026-07-21; see docs/BRAND.md).
 * `useTheme()` returns the one theme; it is a hook so a stored preference or a
 * second theme could be layered in here later without any screen changing.
 *
 * Usage inside a component:
 *   const t = useTheme();
 *   <View style={{ backgroundColor: t.bg.surface }}>
 *
 * Module-scope StyleSheet.create (which cannot call a hook) uses getTheme():
 *   const t = getTheme();
 *   const styles = StyleSheet.create({ card: { backgroundColor: t.bg.surface } });
 * This is safe precisely because the theme is static (single light theme) — the
 * value is fixed at module load. If a second theme is ever added, those static
 * styles are where it would need revisiting; screens using useTheme() would not.
 *
 * Names describe ROLE, not appearance — `text.muted`, never `text.grey`.
 *
 * Copied from the sibling time-tracker, which carries the fuller token set
 * (accent.gold / goldText / sage decorative accents, bg.goldSoft, bg.sage,
 * accent.onAccentMuted). This app needs those for recording status chips.
 * See docs/BRAND.md.
