/**
 * Raw color values. THE ONLY FILE IN THE APP ALLOWED TO CONTAIN COLOR LITERALS —
 * an ESLint rule enforces this everywhere under app/ except app/src/theme.
 *
 * These are the Sabeel Institute brand colors, **Option 1** — the designer's
 * revised palette (2026-07-21), which SUPERSEDES the original
 * `docs/brand/sabeel-color-usage-guide.jpg`. `docs/BRAND.md` restates it and
 * records where this palette deliberately departs from it for accessibility
 * (body text and gold-as-signal need deeper cuts). Read BRAND.md first.
 *
 * SINGLE LIGHT THEME. There is no dark mode — decided 2026-07-21. The app is
 * light only; `palette` is one object, not light/dark variants.
 *
 *   Warm Ivory     #F6EBDD   foundation — backgrounds, cards
 *   Soft Sage      #A8B89A   calm & community — alternate surfaces
 *   Dark Raspberry #83114F   brand identity — headings, buttons, links
 *   Antique Gold   #C6A15B   elegance — dividers, accents, hover
 *   Mushroom Taupe #A58D7A   support — borders, captions, shadows
 *
 * Option 1 is a real revision, not a re-measure: raspberry moved from a brick
 * red (#82163A) to this plum (ΔE ~17), and gold to a muted tan (ΔE ~13). Both
 * Both sibling apps (time-tracker, kanban) ship this same palette; this file is
 * a copy of the time-tracker's, which is the richer of the two.
 *
 * Nothing outside src/theme imports this. Screens consume the semantic tokens in
 * ./index.ts, so a brand refresh is a one-file change.
