 * A student's own attendance marks for one course.

 * Reads the server-written projection rather than the session, because a session
 * holds the whole roster's marks and no rule can show one student their own key
 * of that map. Self-constrained on `studentUid`, as the rule requires; adding
 * `courseId` keeps it to one class and costs no index, since both filters are
 * equalities.
 *
 * Ordering is done in the caller rather than with `orderBy`, which would turn
 * this into a composite-index query for a list that is one term long.
 *
 *  `null` until the listener answers, so an empty sentence is never printed for
 *  a question not yet answered.
