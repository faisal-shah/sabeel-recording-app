/**
 * Web side of the push seam (native sibling: push.ts).
 *
 * Web push needs three things the SDK does not supply, and missing any of them
 * fails silently rather than loudly:
 *
 *  1. A **service worker** at the origin root — `/firebase-messaging-sw.js`.
 *     It lives in `app/public/`, which `expo export` copies verbatim into
 *     `dist-web`. Firebase Hosting serves a matching real file before applying
 *     the `**` → `/index.html` rewrite, so no rewrite exception is needed, but
 *     the file must genuinely be in the export — verify against the exported
 *     bundle, never the dev server.
 *  2. A **VAPID key pair**, generated in the console. The public half is not a
 *     secret and ships in the bundle; without it `getToken` throws.
 *  3. **Notification permission**, which only a user gesture may request. The
 *     home-screen nudge and the settings screen ask, both on a press; nothing
 *     here prompts on load.
 *
 * Every failure returns null. A browser with notifications blocked, an
 * unsupported one, and a build with no VAPID key are all the same answer to the
 * caller — "this device cannot receive push" — and the settings screen says so
 * rather than showing switches that could never fire.

 * this tab or opens the app (`notificationclick` in firebase-messaging-sw.js,
