/**
 * Web push service worker.
 *
 * It exists to receive messages while the tab is closed — that is the whole of
 * its job, and it cannot be part of the app bundle: a service worker has to be a
 * separate file served from the origin root, or its scope is limited to the
 * directory it came from.
 *
 * `app/public/` is copied verbatim into `dist-web` by `expo export`, and Firebase
 * Hosting serves a matching real file before applying the `**` → `/index.html`
 * rewrite — so no rewrite exception is needed, but the file must genuinely reach
 * the export. Check the EXPORTED bundle, never the dev server.
 *
 * The compat SDK, deliberately: a service worker has no bundler, and the modular
 * SDK cannot be loaded from a plain `importScripts`. The version is pinned
 * rather than floating, because a worker that fails to parse does not fall back
 * to anything — push simply stops, silently.

// Registering messaging is enough for a closed or hidden tab: the SDK shows the

// click opens the link the server set. A custom onBackgroundMessage handler
// here would produce a SECOND banner alongside the automatic one.
//
// With a window visible the SDK draws nothing and forwards the payload to the
// page, which shows it through this registration (push.web.ts,
// showForegroundPush) — so the click on THAT banner lands here too, and the
// SDK's own click handler ignores it (no FCM_MSG in its data). This one acts
// only on notifications the page shaped, marked `data.page`, and leaves the
// SDK's to the SDK: focus a window of ours if one is open, else open the app.
