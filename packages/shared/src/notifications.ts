/**
 * The three messages, and deliberately no more.

 *    Under the excused-only policy this is also "you now have access", so
 *    without it a student has no way to learn a recording appeared.
 *  - `lastDay` — the morning of the due date, if not yet complete. There is no
 *    day-after reminder: once the deadline passes access has closed, so the
 *    message could only say "you missed it", which is a scolding with no action
 *    attached.
 *  - `attendanceMissing` — staff, when a session's date has passed and
 *    attendance was never submitted. Load-bearing under this policy: no
 *    attendance means nobody is granted anything, so an un-taken sheet silently
 *    locks a whole class out of a published recording.

 * The Android notification channel every push is posted to.

 * Shared because BOTH sides have to name it and neither can check the other:
 * the app creates the channel, the server addresses it by id, and a typo on
 * either side is silent. A send naming no channel does not fail — Android posts
 * it to FCM's own `fcm_fallback_notification_channel`, which it labels
 * **"Miscellaneous"** in the app's notification settings.
 *
 * That fallback is exactly what was happening, confirmed on a device on
 * 2026-08-28: `push.ts` created a channel called "Class recordings" that
 * nothing ever posted to, because `fcmSender` sent no channel at all. The
 * sibling kanban app hit the identical bug and fixed it the same way; this is
 * deliberately its shape, down to the constant names, so the two do not drift.
 *
 * IMPORTANCE_HIGH, and it has to be right FIRST TIME: Android fixes a channel's
 * importance when the channel is created and an app may never raise it
 * afterwards — only the person can. That is also why this is a NEW channel id
 * rather than a correction to the old one, which already exists at DEFAULT
 * importance on every device that has run this app. HIGH matches the sibling
 * and means a deadline message can raise a heads-up banner; the old fallback
 * sat at DEFAULT, so this is the one deliberate change in how loud these are.
