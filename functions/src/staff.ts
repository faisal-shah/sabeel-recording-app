   * DISABLE THE AUTH USER TOO, exactly as the student path does.
   *
   * Claims only change when a token refreshes, which is up to an hour — so
   * setting `status: 'disabled'` and stopping there left a removed manager
   * working normally for the rest of that hour, writing to their classes. The
   * manual makes one promise for both populations ("Disable a student or staff
   * member to switch off access while keeping their history"), and only one of
   * them kept it.
   *
   * ORDER: auth user, then claims, then the mirror — and the mirror LAST on
   * purpose. There are three writes and no transaction spanning Auth and
   * Firestore, so a failure between them is a state someone has to get out of.
   * Writing the mirror last makes every interim state fail SAFE and repair by
   * repetition:
   *
   *   - Disabling, claims throw → the account is already shut out of Auth while
   *     the mirror still reads active. Tighter than intended, never looser.
   *   - Enabling, claims throw → they can sign in again but every guard still
   *     reads `status: 'disabled'` from the token, so they land on the gate.
   *     Again tighter than intended.
   *
   * In both, the screen still shows the OLD status, so the admin's next move is
   * to press the same button — which re-runs all three writes idempotently and
   * lands the intended state. Writing the mirror first would invert this: the
   * screen would report the change as done while the enforcement had not
   * happened, and there would be no control left that looked like the repair.
