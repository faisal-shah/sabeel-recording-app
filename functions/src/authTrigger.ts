/**
 * Server-side account provisioning and domain enforcement, for every new
 * Firebase Auth user. The decision is in `provision.ts`; this performs it.
 *
 * This is the ONLY gate on who gets an account, which was not the original
 * intent. The plan was to disable client-side sign-up in the console and let
 * this handle domain enforcement alone; that setting
 * (`client.permissions.disabledUserSignup`) turns out to block a staff member's
 * FIRST Google sign-in too — creating their account is a sign-up — so it fails
 * with `auth/admin-restricted-operation` before this trigger ever runs. Staff
 * self-onboarding and disabled sign-up are mutually exclusive. Verified against
 * the live project, 2026-07-22.
 *
 * Gen-1 auth trigger: `beforeUserCreated` (a blocking function) would reject
 * before the auth user exists at all, closing the seconds-long window in which a
 * rejected account exists. It needs the project upgraded to Identity Platform.
 * Worth doing now that this is the only gate — but the window is still not
 * exploitable, because an account this trigger rejects has no custom claims, and
 * every rule gates on `status == 'active'` defaulting to `''`.
 *
 * Deleting a rejected account rather than marking it `rejected` keeps
 * `staffUsers` meaningful: everything in it is someone who legitimately reached
 * the approval queue, so the admin's list is never padded with junk that has to
 * be mentally filtered.
