/**

 * Bindings only — every decision is in `notifyJobs`, which the integration tests
 * drive directly with the FCM sender stubbed. There is no FCM emulator, so that
 * split is the difference between logic that is tested and logic that is hoped
 * for.
 */

/**
 * A grant became active: tell the student their recording is ready.
 *
 * Fires only on the false→true edge. Reconciles are frequent and idempotent —
 * every attendance correction rewrites every grant on the session — so firing on
 * any write would send one notification per staff edit. The `sent` marker would
 * catch it anyway; this keeps the work off the wire in the first place.

/**
 * A device registered to one account stops being registered to any other.
 *
 * SIGN-OUT CANNOT BE RELIED ON TO DO THIS. `unregisterThisDevice` runs while the
 * credential still exists and is bounded so the button cannot hang offline — but
 * a delete that has not been acknowledged when `signOut()` drops the credential
 * is never sent, and neither is one interrupted by the app being killed. The
 * registration that survives is a perfectly valid token, so `notifyOnce`'s
 * pruning never touches it: the next "a recording is ready" for the student who
 * signed OUT is delivered to the phone the next student is holding. That is a
 * privacy leak and the most confusing notification this app could send.
 *
 * So the claim is settled server-side, where no credential is needed: a token is
 * registered to exactly one account, the most recent one. This also covers the
 * ordinary shared-device case, where nothing failed at all — two students on one
 * phone, the first signing out cleanly, is the same end state.
 *
 * The collection-group query needs `devices.token` indexed at COLLECTION_GROUP
 * scope; Firestore does not create those automatically, so it is declared in
 * `firestore.indexes.json` — along with the collection-scope entries, because a
 * `fieldOverrides` block REPLACES the automatic set for that field rather than
 * adding to it. `scripts/check-query-shapes.mjs` sends this shape against the
 * real project, which is the only place a missing index shows up: the emulator
 * serves any shape, and the symptom in production would be a device quietly
 * staying registered to a previous account.

       * trigger that trusts its own params to be the winner then has each one
       * delete the other's row — both accounts lose the device, which is worse
       * than the leak this exists to close. An order both invocations agree on
       * makes them converge on the same survivor.
       *
       * `updateTime`, NOT the document's own `registeredAt`. That field is written
       * by the client, so a student who wrote `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` onto
       * their own row would win every future comparison — and a backwards clock

       * `updateTime` is Firestore's, at nanosecond resolution; the path breaks a
       * tie so agreement does not depend on sort stability.
       *
       * WHAT THIS STILL DOES NOT STOP, stated rather than glossed. FCM tokens
       * carry no proof of possession, and the rules cannot invent one: any
       * active account may write ANY token string under its own uid. So a
       * student who has used a shared device — and therefore read its token off
       * their own registration — can re-register it later from anywhere, become
       * the newest row, and have this sweep delete the current holder's. That
       * turns a leak (their notifications reaching a device someone else is
       * holding, which is what happened before the sweep existed) into a leak
       * plus a silent denial for the rightful holder.
       *
       * It is not a reason to drop the sweep: the failure it fixes is the
       * ordinary one — a sign-out whose unregister never reached the backend —
       * and that has no attacker in it at all. But the residual is real, it is
       * bounded to devices the attacker has personally used, and it is written
       * down in `TODO.md` rather than left implied by an over-confident comment.
