/**
 * The account behind the token is still live — checked against the user
 * record, on every call.
 *
 * An ID token is a bearer credential until it expires, up to an hour: the
 * platform verifies its signature and hands the callable its claims, and
 * neither consults the user record again. So `setStaffAccess` and
 * `setStudentAccess` disabled the Auth user, wrote `status: 'disabled'` into
 * the claims, and a client holding the OLD token went on minting playback URLs
 * and submitting registers until it expired — with the manual promising
 * "immediately". The app signs itself out within seconds through the profile
 * listener; this is for whoever does not.
 *
 * `checkRevoked` re-reads the user. One Auth lookup per call. An
 * unauthenticated call has nothing to check — `accountExists` is one — and the
 * handler decides. Three answers are refusals, each in the words that are
 * true of it:
 *
 *  - DISABLED, or the account gone: "Account is not active.", the sentence
 *    `requireActive` uses. A deleted account's token is not a fault to report
 *    — rethrown, it reached the wrapper as `internal` and Sentry on every call
 *    the still-valid token made.
 *  - REVOKED: "Your session has ended. Sign in again." Revocation is what
 *    disabling does, but not only that — Firebase revokes every session when a
 *    password is reset, so a student who asked for a password link from a
 *    browser held, on their phone, a token this refuses for up to an hour.
 *    Told their account was not active, they had no reason to sign in again,
 *    which is the one thing that fixes it.
