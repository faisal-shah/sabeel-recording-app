/**
 * Deliver one message to one person, once.
 *
 * The one path every notification takes, so the three rules that make push
 * bearable live in one place rather than three:
 *
 *  1. **Their switch decides.** A missing preferences document means ON — a
 *     person who has never opened the settings screen should still hear about a
 *     recording, and defaulting the absent document to OFF would mean nobody is
 *     ever notified until they visit a screen whose purpose is turning
 *     notifications off.
 *  2. **Once.** Trigger delivery is at-least-once and the scheduled job runs
 *     every morning regardless of whether yesterday's finished, so without a
 *     durable marker a student would be told twice about the same recording. The
 *     marker is written BEFORE the send, and a create that loses the race is
 *     what stops the second delivery — checking first and writing after would
 *     leave a window two invocations can both pass through. It is claimed only
 *     once there is somewhere to send: claiming it for a person with no
 *     registered device would spend the one delivery on nobody, permanently.
 *     And only ALREADY_EXISTS means "someone else claimed it" — any other create
 *     failure is rethrown, so the trigger retries rather than reporting a
 *     success that dropped the message.
 *  3. **Dead tokens are pruned, transient failures are not.** Deleting on any
 *     failure would unregister working devices during an outage, and the only
 *     symptom would be notifications quietly stopping.
 *
 * Returns whether anything was actually sent, which is what the tests assert on.
