/**
 * Does an account already exist for the holder of this Google token?
 *
 * THE ANDROID APP MUST NEVER CREATE AN ACCOUNT. Not a preference: both stores
 * require in-app account DELETION only if an app *supports account creation* —
 * Apple 5.1.1(v), and Play, which also triggers if the app "directs the user to
 * an app account creation flow outside of the app". Satisfy neither trigger and
 * neither requirement is engaged, which is what lets this app ship without a
 * deletion flow that would have to decide what happens to a student's academic
 * record when they delete themselves. Records are retained; FERPA gives a right
 * to inspect and amend, never to erase. `sabeel-institute-kanban/docs/
 * STORE-RELEASE.md` is the decision record for all three apps.
 *
 * `signInWithCredential` is the line that creates an account, so the native
 * sign-in path asks this first and never reaches that line for an identity with
 * no account. Creation happens on the WEB app only, where staff sign-in stays
 * self-service and the existing flow already is the creation flow.
 *
 * ONLY THE GOOGLE DOOR NEEDS THIS. A student signs in with email and password,
 * and `signInWithEmailAndPassword` cannot bring an account into existence — it
 * fails when there is none. `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` is the call that
 * would, and this app has never had it on any surface.
 *
 * UNAUTHENTICATED, necessarily — there is no session yet; establishing one is
 * the thing being gated. Safe here because the caller has already proved they
 * control the address by presenting a Google-signed token for it, so this is not
 * an oracle that can be pointed at an arbitrary email.
 *
 * It also cannot be done on the client: `fetchSignInMethodsForEmail` returns an
 * empty array for every project created after 15 September 2023, because email
 * enumeration protection is on by default. An Admin SDK callable is Firebase's
 * documented replacement.
