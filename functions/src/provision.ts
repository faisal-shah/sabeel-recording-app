/**
 * The decision half of new-user provisioning, kept pure so every branch can be
 * tested exhaustively without an emulator or the Admin SDK. `authTrigger.ts`
 * performs the effects.
 *
 * This app has TWO auth populations, which is what makes it differ from the
 * sibling kanban app (whose trigger deletes anything not on the org domain — a
 * rule that here would delete every student):
 *
 *  - Google sign-in is STAFF. Domain-gated, and lands pending.
 *  - Email/password is a STUDENT, and can only be minted by the Admin SDK from
 *    the createStudent callable, which sets claims and writes the document
 *    itself. The trigger must keep its hands off, or it races that callable.
 *  - Anything else is deleted.
