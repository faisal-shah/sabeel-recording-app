/**
 * "Managers are scoped class by class" — proved against the CALLABLES, one row
 * per call site, rather than against the guard in isolation.
 *
 * `guards.integration.test.ts` next door proves `requireCourseScope` answers
 * correctly. It cannot prove anybody CALLS it, and nothing else did: deleting
 * the line from any single callable left every suite in this repo green while
 * that one action was open to every manager in the institute. The guard being
 * tested and the guard being wired are two different claims, and only the second
 * is what a student's classmate in another cohort depends on.
 *
 * SO THE TABLE IS THE TEST. A row per `requireCourseScope` call site in
 * `functions/src`, driven through `onCall`'s `.run()` so the real handler runs —
 * validation, lookups, guard and all. Adding a course-scoped callable without
 * adding a row here is the gap this is built to make obvious; `functions/src`
 * has sixteen call sites and the table has sixteen rows, and the last test in
 * the file holds those two numbers together.
 *
 * TWO ASSERTIONS PER ROW, because one is not enough. "A manager of another class
 * is refused" passes just as well when the payload is malformed, the document is
 * missing, or the callable rejects everyone — none of which is the promise. So
 * each row is also called by the manager who DOES run the class, and asserted
 * NOT to be refused with `permission-denied`. Payload validation and missing
 * documents fire identically for both callers; only the scope check tells them
 * apart. The second assertion is deliberately weak on everything else — several
 * of these then fail for their own good reasons (no Zoom credentials, no
 * uploaded object, a session that already has a recording), and pinning those
 * would be pinning the fixture rather than the promise.
