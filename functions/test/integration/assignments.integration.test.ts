  /*
   * THE PROMISE THIS COLLECTION EXISTS FOR: a student sees their own mark and
   * NOTHING about anybody else's. `app/src/attendance.ts` states it — a session
   * holds the whole roster's marks, Firestore has no field-level security, and
   * no rule can show one student their own key of that map.
   *
   * `toEqual`, NOT `toMatchObject`, and that is the entire point. Every other
   * document assertion in this repo checks fields it names; none says what must
   * NOT be there. So a plausible edit — `{ ...session, studentUid, status }`, to
   * denormalise one more thing for the student screen — puts the whole roster's
   * `attendance` map into every student's own row, readable by each of them,
   * and passes every one of those assertions. TypeScript does not catch it
   * either: excess-property checking does not apply to spread properties.
