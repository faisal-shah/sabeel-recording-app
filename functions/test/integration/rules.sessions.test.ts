   * documents. For a MANAGER each returned document resolves a
   * `get(courses/{id})`, cached per distinct path — so the cost is one call per
   * COURSE however many sessions come back — and Firestore caps the
   * document-access calls in a single request. That cap is the real constraint
   * on how many courses the queue may span, and it is not the `in` clause's own
   * limit.
   *
   * WHAT THIS PROVES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. It proves the rule's SHAPE — that
   * the manager arm serves the exact query the queue sends, with every row
   * returned, and that the same query at a wider scope is refused for a manager
   * and not for an admin. It does NOT establish the ceiling: the emulator does
   * not enforce Firestore's per-request document-access limit, and its own
   * ceiling is only BRACKETED by this pair, somewhere between the width served
   * here and the width refused below. A rule change that spent one more `get()`
   * per row could land inside that band with both halves still green, so treat
   * this as a guard on the rule's shape and read the ceiling off the docs.
   * `QUEUE_SCOPE.manager` comes from that documented limit; see the note on the
   * constant.
   *
   * If this ever goes red, lower `QUEUE_SCOPE.manager`; do not widen the rule.
