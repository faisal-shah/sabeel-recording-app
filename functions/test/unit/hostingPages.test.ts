/**
 * The three pages a store reviewer reads, and the two ways they break silently.
 *
 * `npm run smoke:prod` is what actually proves they answer, because it fetches
 * the deployed site the way a reviewer does. This runs in the ordinary suite and
 * catches the same two faults before a deploy rather than after:
 *
 *  1. **A rewrite behind the catch-all.** `**` sends everything to the SPA, so a
 *     `/privacy` listed after it answers 200 with the app shell — a reviewer
 *     finds no policy, and nothing looks broken from here.
 *  2. **A rewrite pointing at a file nobody wrote.** Same 200, same shell.
 *
 * And the link in the app has to agree with the rewrite: `PRIVACY_URL` is opened
 * from the More menu, and a policy that exists at a path the app does not name
 * satisfies nobody.
