/**
 * The workbook vocabulary, stated in two places, held to the same words.
 *
 * `WORKBOOK_DEFINITIONS` is printed into every exported file as its
 * Definitions tab; the manual's Section 2.13 prints the same table so a reader
 * can learn the terms before they open a file. Two copies of a definition are
 * two chances for "Missed deadline" to mean one thing in the workbook and
 * another on the page — so the manual's table must contain each definition
 * verbatim, and nothing the manual calls a workbook term may be missing from
 * the file. Edit the constant, then paste; this fails until you do.
 *
 * Lives in `functions/test/unit` because that workspace is the only one here
 * that reads repo files in tests — same reasoning as `appVersion.test.ts`.
