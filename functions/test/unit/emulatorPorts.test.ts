/**
 * Every place this checkout states an emulator or dev-server port agrees.
 *
 * Three Sabeel repos share one machine, and every one of them used to pin the
 * same ports — so whichever suite started second SIGTERMed the other's
 * Firestore, and both sessions spent real time diagnosing symptoms that belonged
 * to the other process. Each checkout now owns a disjoint block.
 *
 * The ports cannot live in one file. Five consumers need five representations:
 *
 *   firebase.json               JSON   what the emulators actually bind
 *   app/src/env.ts              TS     inlined into the client bundle
 *   scripts/lib/ports.mjs       ESM    read by scripts/*.mjs
 *   free-emulator-ports.sh      shell  the kill list
 *   screens-e2e.sh              shell  the sweep's web dev-server port
 *
 * So the goal is not one copy, it is copies that cannot drift. A mismatch is
 * otherwise silent until something connects to a port nobody is serving — or,
 * far worse, to a port a SIBLING REPO is serving, which reads and writes
 * happily and passes.
 *
 * Lives in `functions/test/unit` because that workspace is the only one here
 * with a runner wired up; it asserts about repo files, not about functions.
 * Same reasoning as `ciCoverage.test.ts` next door.
