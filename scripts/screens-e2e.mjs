 * THE visual/layout regression sweep. Every screen, every width, looked at AND

 *   bash scripts/screens-e2e.sh                       # the CI set
 *   SWEEP_WIDTHS=320 bash scripts/screens-e2e.sh      # one width, tight loop

 *
 * A TOUR THAT CANNOT FAIL IS A SCREENSHOT GENERATOR. This one exits non-zero,
 * and `functions/test/unit/ciCoverage.test.ts` fails if CI ever stops running
 * it. That is the whole difference between this and a folder of pretty pictures
 * nobody diffs.
 *
 * WHAT IT CHECKS, and the failure each check is here for:
 *
 *   - the page never scrolls sideways    the classic responsive failure a
 *                                        top-of-page screenshot never reveals
 *   - nothing is clipped by the right    distinct from the above: a row can
 *     edge                               overflow INSIDE a clipping ancestor, so
 *                                        the page width never moves while a
 *                                        control is sliced in half at the
 *                                        boundary. This app's `rowHeadPinned`
 *                                        rows — a name that may not shrink
 *                                        beside actions that may not shrink —
 *                                        are exactly that shape
 *   - no two same-layer controls         crowding that appears at one width and
 *     overlap                            not another
 *   - every screen has a way out         a pushed screen with no Back is a dead
 *                                        end in a phone browser, where there is
 *                                        no hardware Back either. A tab root is
 *                                        never pushed and correctly has none —
 *                                        the bar or the rail is its exit — so
 *                                        the check asks for whichever applies
 *   - the content column caps at one of  read from `app/src/theme/index.ts`
 *     the declared maxima, and centres   rather than restated here. A reading
 *                                        column and a card grid want opposite
 *                                        things from a wide window, so there is
 *                                        more than one legal answer
 *   - no interactive content nested      `accessibilityRole="button"` becomes a
 *     inside a <button>                  real <button> ELEMENT on web, and keys
 *                                        pressed in a control inside one
 *                                        activate the button
 *   - no fixed-format control is        the only ABSOLUTE-width check here. A
 *     squashed below its own widget      date/time/number input or a select can
 *                                        sit inside its container, overlap
 *                                        nothing, clip nothing, and still be too
 *                                        narrow to read — and unlike a text
 *                                        field, its content cannot be scrolled to
 *   - the page laid out at the width    everything else measures the DOM against
 *     it was asked for                   the DOM, which is silent about WHICH
 *                                        width it ran at. Without this, a
 *                                        viewport option that failed to apply
 *                                        leaves every check passing and every
 *                                        screenshot mislabelled
 *   - targets under 44px are REPORTED    informational, never a failure
 *
 * Deliberately NOT checked: a generic "is any text truncated". It fires on every
 * intentional `numberOfLines` clamp and would drown the real signal. Scope such
 * a check to the one surface that needs it, if any ever does.
 *
 * TWO POPULATIONS, THREE TOURS. Staff and students are different apps behind one
 * binary — different route tables, different homes, no screen in common but the
 * player and notifications — so a sweep that signed in as an admin would have
 * photographed half the product. A manager gets a third tour because their
 * scoping is class-by-class: they see the same screens with fewer rows and fewer
 * controls, which is a different layout, not the same one with less in it.
 *
 * A SCREEN WITH AN EDITOR OPEN IS A DIFFERENT SCREEN. The session editor adds
 * four fields and a Save/Cancel row; the ledger's override adds a reason field
 * and two buttons; a roster removal replaces a row in place with a confirmation.
 * None of those rows exist in any other state, and 320px is where they run out
 * of room — so they are toured explicitly rather than trusted because the screen
 * underneath them measured fine.
 *
 * That paid for itself on the first honest run: the ledger's override laid its
 * two actions out in a bespoke non-wrapping row, and "Mark not complete" ran
 * 27px off the right edge at 320px and at no other width. Fixed by using the
 * shared `Row`, which wraps.
 *
 * The AUDIO PLAYER's behaviour is not this suite's business — background
 * playback, the foreground service and lock-screen controls have no web
 * equivalent and belong on the AVD. Its LAYOUT is, and it is the one screen
 * whose controls sit in a fixed-width row, so it is toured at every width.
 *
 * Seeding goes through the Admin SDK: deterministic, seconds rather than
 * minutes, and rules will not let a client write most of it anyway. The content
 * is chosen to BREAK layouts — the longest name a real cohort would have, a
 * roster longer than one screen, an empty cohort — not to look tidy.
