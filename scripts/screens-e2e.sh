# THIS IS WHY THE SWEEP CAN BE IN CI AND `test:e2e` CANNOT. `npm run test:e2e`
# expects a long-lived emulator suite and a dev server that somebody else
# started, and it wipes Firestore and Auth out from under them. This script owns
# both processes for the length of one run, seeds its own world under ids nobody
# else uses, and deletes nothing — so it composes with a fresh CI runner instead
# of fighting a developer's desk.

# `getPlaybackUrl` for the player screen and `onUserCreate` to provision the
# staff accounts it signs in as, so a stale lib here is a screen that renders an

# Kill anything already on the web port. A LEFTOVER dev server is the nastiest
# failure here: the new `expo start` cannot bind, exits quietly, and the
# readiness poll below gets a cheerful 200 from the stale process — so the whole
# sweep runs against OLD code and reports layout failures for a diff that never
# reached the browser. Kill by port, never `pkill -f "expo start"`: that pattern
# also matches the agent shell that spawned this and takes the caller with it.
# Owners of a port, by port. `ss`, not `lsof`: lsof is NOT on the default
# non-interactive PATH on this box, and both uses below silence stderr — so a
# missing lsof is indistinguishable from "no listener", and BOTH the stale-server
# kill and the cleanup trap become silent no-ops. That is the two safety
# mechanisms in this script switching off with nothing to show for it. Measured:
# `lsof -ti:61110 ... | wc -l` returns 0 without the toolchain env sourced while
# a server is demonstrably bound. `scripts/free-emulator-ports.sh` already uses
# `ss` for this; deviating from it was the mistake.

# EXIT alone, and NOT `EXIT INT TERM` — which is the opposite of the usual

# a 2s foreground command: `EXIT` cleaned up at 406ms, `EXIT INT TERM` at 2056ms
# — i.e. only once the foreground command ended. Untrapped, the shell dies at
# once on the signal and bash still runs the EXIT trap, which is what we want.
# (A Node harness is the reverse case: its handlers fire immediately, so there
# the explicit signal handlers ARE the fix.)

# leaking one, indefinitely, while the script advertises that it cleans up. The
# leak self-heals only because the pre-run kill above catches the previous run's
# straggler, which is what kept it invisible. `set -e` still propagates the exit
# status, and now the trap actually fires. The reference implementation this was
