/**
 * Send one real push to one device token, from the REAL project.
 *
 *     node scripts/send-test-push.mjs <fcm-token> [title] [body]
 *
 * The device check no emulator can do: FCM has no emulator, and the functions
 * emulator's sender is a stub, so "a push is shown" is proved only by a real
 * message reaching a real device — with the app open (expo-notifications /
 * the page draws it) and then closed (FCM's own display draws it). Same shape
 * `fcmSender` sends: notification + data, the app's channel, the web link.
 *
 * Writes nothing: no Firestore document, no audit row, no notification
 * record. The token comes from wherever the device registered it — the
 * emulator's `devices` collection for a debug build signed in against the
 * emulators (the token is still a real FCM token for this project's sender),
 * or production's for a release build.
