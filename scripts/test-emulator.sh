# The Functions emulator loads the BUILT bundle (functions/lib, per `main`), not
# the TypeScript. Nothing else in this script builds it, so without this the
# triggers under test are whatever was last compiled — while the test bodies run
# fresh source through vitest. That gap is invisible: the suite still passes, it
# just proves yesterday's trigger. It cost a debugging session on 2026-08-14,
# when the excused-only fan-out was live in src and the emulator kept assigning
# absentees from a two-day-old lib.
