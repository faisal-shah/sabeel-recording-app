/**
 * Is the push SEND PATH reachable and authenticated against the real project?
 *
 *     npm run check:push
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: there is no FCM emulator, so the tests stub the sender and
 * assert only who WOULD have been messaged. That leaves `functions/src/messaging.ts`
 * with no automated coverage at all, and the signature failure of push is that
 * every visible part works while nothing is delivered.
 *
 * It proves the two things provable without a device:
 *
 *   1. **The client half is configured.** `VAPID_PUBLIC_KEY` is present and is a
 *      real uncompressed P-256 point — which is what a browser refuses if it was
 *      truncated, or pasted from the wrong field.
 *   2. **The server half is reachable and authorized.** A send to a deliberately
 *      bogus token comes back `registration-token-not-registered`, meaning the
 *      request reached FCM and was accepted as OURS. Cloud Messaging disabled,
 *      the wrong project, or absent credentials all fail differently, earlier,
 *      and loudly.
 *
 * The same call pins the pruning logic to reality: the code FCM returns for a
 * dead token is the first entry in DEAD_TOKEN_CODES — confirmed, not guessed
 * from documentation.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT DO is mint a browser token. Playwright's Chromium is the
 * open-source build, which ships without the Google API keys needed to reach
 * FCM's push service, and branded Chrome under Playwright refuses too
 * (`AbortError: Registration failed - permission denied`). Neither says anything
 * about this project's key. Web delivery is a human check in a real browser;
 * Android delivery was confirmed on a device on 2026-08-15 (see the
 * verification log in docs/PHASE_STATUS.md).
 *
 * Reads and writes nothing: no Firestore, no documents, no real recipient.
