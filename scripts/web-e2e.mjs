/**
 * End-to-end walkthrough against the web dev server and the emulator suite.
 *
 * Exists because a sign-in screenshot is evidence about nothing else — it is the
 * only screen an unauthenticated script can reach, and it exercises almost none
 * of the app. This drives the real flows and screenshots the authenticated
 * screens, so a phase can be verified without re-deriving the same manual clicks
 * every time.
 *
 * Model: Cohort → Course → Session → Recording. A session owns attendance
 * (present/absent/excused). Being marked EXCUSED is the whole of a student's
 * entitlement: it grants the recording and requires listening to it, once the
 * recording is published AND attendance has been submitted, and it lapses when
 * the session's due date passes. Present and absent grant nothing. There is no
 * "catch-up" concept — a student enrolled after a session's attendance snapshot
 * is simply never in it (enrollment-onward).
 *
 * Prerequisites (see docs/DEV-TOOLING.md):
 *   firebase emulators:start --project demo-sabeel-recordings --only firestore,auth,storage,functions
 *   cd app && EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_EMULATORS=1 npx expo start --web --port 61111 --clear
 *
 * Then: npm run test:e2e
 *
 * SCOPE: this exercises real user FLOWS end to end. It is not a security suite —
 * most screens only query what the user may see, so a widened rule can leave
 * every screen looking correct. Authorization is asserted in
 * functions/test/integration/rules.*.test.ts, which are mutation-tested.
 *
 * Screenshots land in e2e-shots/ (gitignored). LOOK AT THEM — correct values in
 * palette.ts survive right up until you read the rendered screen.
