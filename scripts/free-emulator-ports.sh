# Free the Firebase emulator ports, killing whatever still holds them.
#
# Why this exists: a killed or crashed run leaves emulators squatting on these
# ports. The next run then talks to a HALF-DEAD emulator — one that answers on
# the port but has no functions registered — and every callable 404s. In the
# browser that surfaces as "blocked by CORS policy" (a 404 carries no CORS
# headers) and the app shows a bare "internal", so the symptom points at the
# app, not at the leftover process. Cost hours on 2026-07-20.
#
# Look up owners BY PORT, never `pkill -f firebase`: a pattern like that also
# matches this script's own command line (and the agent shell that spawned it),
# so the "cleanup" kills the caller — observed as a shell exiting with 144.

# The leftovers that hold NO port, and so survive everything above.
#
# When a run is killed, the functions emulator's Node runtime workers can outlive
# it and reparent to init at ~150 MB each. Every port check says the block is
# clear, so the next run starts happily and leaks another batch. Measured after
# three interrupted runs: twelve orphans, ~1.7 GB.
#
# The damage lands on a LATER run, which is what makes it so confusing: a long
# browser suite dies partway with ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED against its own dev
# server, at a different screen each time, and the dev server's log ends with no
# error at all. It reads as a bug in whatever you changed most recently. It cost
# two failed sweeps and a wrong hypothesis on 2026-08-28.
#
# Matched by cwd, not by name: sibling checkouts on this machine run the exact
# same binary, and killing theirs is the thing this whole port scheme exists to
# stop.
#
# An orphan is one whose PARENT IS NO LONGER THE EMULATOR THAT SPAWNED IT — not
# one whose ppid is 1. Testing for ppid==1 made this whole function inert here:
# on a systemd user session the kernel reparents to `systemd --user`, not to
# init, so the test never matched and the reaper reported nothing while 24
# runtimes sat holding 1.3 GB. Found on 2026-08-28, hours after the run that
# leaked them, when a release build died on Gradle metaspace exhaustion.
#
# So: alive parent that is still firebase-tools means a run owns this worker,
# leave it. Anything else — reparented, or a parent already gone — is an
# orphan.
