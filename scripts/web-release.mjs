/**
 * Build the web bundle FOR DEPLOY, with Sentry source maps.
 *
 * Runs as the hosting predeploy. Four steps:
 *   1. Export with external source maps (plain `web:export` emits none).
 *   2. Inject Sentry "debug IDs" into the JS and the maps. Debug IDs match a
 *      runtime error to its map with no release/version coordination.
 *   3. Upload the maps to the `sabeel-recording-web` Sentry project.
 *   4. DELETE the .map files from the deploy dir, so Firebase Hosting never
 *      serves them publicly — the maps live in Sentry, not on the open web. The
 *      shipped JS keeps its debug id, so events still symbolicate.
 *
 * The Sentry steps are skipped (with a note) when the gitignored
 * app/android/sentry.properties has no auth token — a fresh clone or CI can
 * still build and deploy, just without uploading maps. The token is read only by
 * sentry-cli, via SENTRY_PROPERTIES; it never passes through this script.
