 * what drifts.

 * The content is chosen to BREAK layouts and to cover every state a screen can
 * be in — the longest name a real cohort would write, a roster longer than one
 * screen, an empty cohort, an archived one, a session whose attendance was
 * never taken, a draft, a recording that needs attention — not to look tidy.
 * Read the comments inside: most of them record a bug this shape once caught.
