/**
 * This checkout's Firebase emulator and dev-server ports — the one place
 * `scripts/*.mjs` read them.
 *
 * Several files have to agree and cannot share a representation: this one (ESM),
 * `firebase.json` (JSON, what the emulators bind), `app/src/env.ts` (TS, inlined
 * into the client bundle at build time), the `PORTS=(…)` array in
 * `free-emulator-ports.sh` and the `WEB_PORT` default in `screens-e2e.sh`
 * (shell). The copies are unavoidable; the copies drifting is not.
 * `functions/test/unit/emulatorPorts.test.ts` asserts they agree, so a change to
 * one of them fails the unit suite in seconds rather than surfacing later as an
 * emulator that answers on a port nobody expected — or, far worse, as a SIBLING
 * repo's emulator answering, which reads and writes happily and passes.
 *
 * 61100+ because this machine's ephemeral range is 32768-60999
 * (`/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range`), so nothing above it is handed out
 * at random, and Firebase's own defaults top out at 9499
 * (`firebase-tools/lib/emulator/constants.js`), so the block collides with
 * nothing the CLI would pick for itself. The bases are 100 apart, one per repo
 * on this machine, so `61103` reads as "this project, functions" at a glance —
 * the diagnostic that was missing when one session killed another's emulator
 * after misreading a truncated `ps` line.
