# Dev tooling

What each script guards against, and which failures are environmental rather
than yours. Read this before debugging the harness.

**First question when a suite fails: does it also fail on stashed changes?** A
clean-HEAD repro means the cause is environmental — almost always a leftover
emulator — not your diff.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run lint` | ESLint + `check:text` |
| `npm run typecheck` | Builds `@sabeel/shared` first, then typechecks every workspace |
| `npm test` | Vitest unit tests (shared + functions), no emulators needed |
| `npm run test:emulator` | Firestore + Auth + Storage emulators, then the rules suite |
| `npm run knip` | Dead-code audit — fails on unused files, exports and dependencies |
| `npm run emulators:free` | Kills whatever is squatting on the emulator ports |
| `npm run build` | Builds shared, then bundles functions with esbuild |
| `npm run test:e2e` | Playwright walkthrough against the web dev server (see below) |
| `npm run test:screens` | The multi-width layout sweep — starts its own emulators and dev server (see below) |
| `npm run web:export -w @sabeel/app` | The web bundle that actually ships |
| `scripts/emulator.sh headless` | Boots the `tb_emu` AVD with no window |

## Setting up a machine

Node 22+, **two** JDKs — 21 for the Firebase emulators (they are Java), 17 as
the default `java` because the Android Gradle Plugin targets it — plus the
Android SDK and the `tb_emu` AVD.

Do not install these by hand. The `expo-firebase-stack` skill in
`../agent-skills/` carries a bootstrap that installs the lot under `$HOME` with
no root, and is idempotent:

```sh
../agent-skills/skills/expo-firebase-stack/tools/check-host.sh   # what is missing
../agent-skills/skills/expo-firebase-stack/tools/bootstrap-linux.sh \
    --jdk21-aliases SR --repo "$PWD"
```

`--jdk21-aliases SR` sets `SR_JDK21_HOME`, which
`scripts/test-emulator.sh` reads to find JDK 21 without disturbing the Gradle
default.

**The Android emulator needs hardware virtualization, which a VM may not have.**
`emulator -accel-check` is authoritative — `accel: 3` means no KVM, and if
`/proc/cpuinfo` shows `hypervisor` with neither `vmx` nor `svm` then nested
virtualization is off at the host and nothing inside the machine, root
included, can enable it. The AVD still boots in software: measured at **805 s
to boot and ~14 s per `screencap`**, so screenshot-based verification stops
being practical while input events (~1.4 s) remain usable. **Builds are
unaffected** — Gradle needs no KVM. `check-host.sh` gives the verdict.

## The ESLint rules that are not style

Two rules encode real incidents and should not be relaxed:

- **No hardcoded colours** under `app/**`, exempting `app/src/theme/**`. Every
  colour goes through a semantic token, which is what made the sibling apps'
  Option-1 palette refresh a one-file change.
- **No `onSnapshot` import** outside `app/src/liveQuery.ts`. Hand-rolled
  subscription state persists across dependency changes, showing the previous
  query's results under the new one on a slow connection. That cost the sibling
  time-tracker a week
  (its `docs/POSTMORTEM-2026-07-16-stale-week.md`).

  Two files are exempt: `liveQuery.ts` is the choke point itself, and
  `session.ts` subscribes inside `onAuthStateChanged` rather than a hook — it
  cannot call one there, and it already does its own reset on every auth change.

## knip: expected output

Two **configuration hints** are expected until the first platform seam exists:

```
src/**/*.web.ts    Refine entry pattern (no matches)
src/**/*.web.tsx   Refine entry pattern (no matches)
```

They are hints, not errors — knip still exits 0. The patterns are there so that
Phase 1's first `.web.ts` seam is treated as an entry point rather than reported
as dead code, which is knip's most common false positive in this stack.

`ignoreDependencies` in the `app` workspace lists `expo-updates`,
`@expo/metro-runtime` and `expo-system-ui`: Expo's config references them
implicitly, so knip reports them as "unlisted" without it.

**knip is load-bearing, which is why infrastructure is added with its first
consumer rather than ahead of it.** Firestore/Storage/Auth initialisation,
`liveQuery.ts` and navigation were all deliberately left out of Phase 0 because
nothing used them. Suppressing knip to keep unused scaffolding would make the
audit lie, and an audit that reports nothing is worse than no audit.

## Emulators

- **JDK 21+ required.** `scripts/test-emulator.sh` resolves `SR_JDK21_HOME` →
  `~/opt/jdk-21` → whatever `java` is on PATH, so JDK 17 can stay the default for
  the Android/Gradle build.
> **This checkout owns emulator ports 61100-61107** and web dev-server ports
> 61110 (sweep) / 61111 (`test:e2e`). The sibling Sabeel repos own 61000+ and
> 61200+. Three of them share this machine and all three used to pin
> 8080/9099/5001/9199, so whichever suite started second killed the other's
> Firestore. `61103` also reads as "this project, functions" at a glance — the
> diagnostic that was missing when one session killed another's emulator after
> misreading a truncated `ps` line.
>
> 61100+ specifically: the ephemeral range here is 32768-60999
> (`/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range`) so nothing above it is handed out at
> random, and Firebase's own defaults top out at 9499
> (`firebase-tools/lib/emulator/constants.js`) so the block cannot collide with
> something the CLI picks for itself.
>
> Five files state these numbers and cannot share a representation —
> `firebase.json`, `app/src/env.ts` (inlined into the bundle),
> `scripts/lib/ports.mjs`, the `PORTS=(…)` array in `free-emulator-ports.sh` and
> the `WEB_PORT` default in `screens-e2e.sh`.
> `functions/test/unit/emulatorPorts.test.ts` asserts they agree, that every port
> is inside the block, and that the kill list contains **nothing this checkout
> does not own**. Never widen that array past the block.
>
> Two are easy to move wrongly: `firestore.websocketPort` is a **nested** key
> defaulting to **9150** that is *not* derived from `firestore.port`, and left
> unset it silently **increments** on collision rather than erroring; and
> `ui`/`hub`/`logging` have `FIND_AVAILBLE_PORT_BY_DEFAULT = true`, so they drift
> silently until pinned. Metro's **8081** is not in the scheme and cannot be —
> the AVD reaches the host directly at `10.0.2.2:8081`, so concurrent *web* work
> is fine and concurrent *native* work stays one session at a time.

- **`free-emulator-ports.sh` runs first, every time.** A killed run leaves
  emulators squatting on this checkout's ports, **61100-61107**. The
  next run then talks to a half-dead emulator that answers on the port but has no
  functions registered, so every callable 404s — and a 404 carries no CORS
  headers, so the browser reports "blocked by CORS policy" while the callable
  surfaces a bare `internal`. Every symptom points at the app rather than at the
  leftover process.
- **Never `pkill -f firebase`.** The pattern matches the cleanup script's own
  command line and the shell that spawned it, so the "cleanup" kills the caller.
  The script looks up owners by port instead. The same trap catches
  `pkill -f "expo start"` / `pkill -f "expo run"` — it matches the agent's own
  tool process and the command exits **144** as its shell is killed mid-run.
  **Kill dev servers by port:** `ss -lptn 'sport = :61111' | grep -oP 'pid=\K[0-9]+' | xargs -r kill`
  (`lsof` is not on PATH in a non-interactive shell without the toolchain env
  sourced, and a missing `lsof` turns a port guard into a silent no-op)
  (or `free-emulator-ports.sh` for the emulator suite).
- **Waiting for the port is not waiting for readiness.** The functions emulator
  accepts connections before it has registered anything. Poll a known callable
  until it stops 404ing.

## The e2e harness

`npm run test:e2e` needs TWO things already running:

```bash
firebase emulators:start --project demo-sabeel-recordings --only firestore,auth,storage,functions
cd app && EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_EMULATORS=1 npx expo start --web --port 61111 --clear
```

**`npm run test:emulator` will kill that emulator suite.** It runs
`free-emulator-ports.sh` first, by design — so the two cannot be used at once,
and after running the unit-style emulator suite you must restart the long-lived
one before the e2e will work. The symptom is every e2e check failing at once.

**It resets Firestore and Auth on every run.** Leftover state silently SKIPS the
paths that matter: an early version left an admin behind, and every later run
then jumped straight past the pending screen while still reporting success.

**It is a FLOW suite, not a security suite.** Most screens only query what the
user is allowed to see, so a widened rule can leave every screen looking
correct — verified by widening the manager-scope rule and watching the e2e
checks stay green. Authorization lives in the rules tests below. The e2e check
names say "the manager's class list omits…" rather than "a manager cannot
see…" for exactly that reason.

Two more things that cost time here:

- **`page.goBack()` works, and is worth asserting.** The navigator has a
  `linking` config, so every screen has a URL and the stack IS browser history.
  Reloading a deep URL restores that screen rather than Home — `goto(WEB)` still
  lands on Home only because `/` is the Home path.
- **Text locators can resolve to hidden nodes.** React Navigation keeps the
  previous screen mounted, so `getByText('Managers')` can match a stale hidden
  element and hang until timeout. `innerText()` is safe for assertions because it
  returns only visible text.

  **`getByTestId` is not the cure, and this suite's helpers do not yet have it.**
  A testID selector is plain CSS and matches inside a `display:none` subtree just
  as happily; only `.filter({ visible: true })` actually excludes the screen
  underneath. `tap()` and `sawText()` here take no visible filter, which is the
  shape that fails the sibling time-tracker's equivalent suite about one run in
  two. `scripts/screens-e2e.mjs` routes every locator through helpers that carry
  the filter; porting the same two lines into `tap()`/`sawText()` is the fix, and
  wants one full run of `npm run test:e2e` behind it before being trusted.

## The screens sweep

`npm run test:screens` (`scripts/screens-e2e.sh` → `scripts/screens-e2e.mjs`) is
the layout regression harness: every screen of both populations at five widths,
**asserted**, and it exits non-zero.

**It needs nothing running.** The runner starts the emulator suite and its own
Expo web dev server on port **61110** (not `test:e2e`'s 61111) and kills both on
the way out. That is the whole reason it is in CI and `test:e2e` is not — it
never touches a world somebody else built.

```bash
npm run test:screens                    # the CI set: 320, 390, 720, 1024, 1440
SWEEP_WIDTHS=320 npm run test:screens   # one width, for a tight loop
SWEEP_FULL=1 npm run test:screens       # + iPhone SE / Pixel 7 / iPad Mini profiles
```

**Automatic CI is OFF (2026-08-28) — run this locally.** `ci.yml` is
`workflow_dispatch` only while the repo is in heavy development: the job is
8m12s, of which this sweep is 337s, and it duplicates what you can run on the
machine you are changing. The full local equivalent is

```bash
npm run lint && npm run typecheck && npm run knip && npm test \
  && npm run test:emulator && npm run test:screens
```

Trigger the job by hand when it earns its time — before a release, or when
something has to hold on a clean machine rather than this one:
`gh workflow run ci.yml --ref <branch>`. The trigger block to restore is written
out at the top of `ci.yml`.

**Scale and cost, measured 2026-08-28:** 674 checks over 5 viewports x 36
screens, **~6m0s wall clock** (361s, including the shared/functions build,
Metro's cold bundle and emulator boot). Up from 623 checks over 34 screens on
2026-08-27: the manager tour gained the recording ledger and its override
editor, which is where a rules failure invisible to an admin had been hiding.
That is what the sweep adds to a CI run, and it is the reason the widths are
five deliberate ones rather than a comfortable-looking grid.

Shots land in `shots/screens/` (gitignored); CI uploads them as an artifact when
the sweep fails. **Look at them** — the sweep says a layout is not broken, never
that it is good.

- **The widths straddle `CONTENT_MAX_WIDTH`, which it READS from
  `app/src/theme/index.ts`.** That constant is the app's whole responsive
  behaviour — full-bleed below it, capped and centred at or above it — and a
  sweep carrying its own copy would drift from the thing it checks. Change the
  constant and the sweep follows.
- **A screen with an editor open is a different screen.** The session editor, the
  ledger's override and a roster removal each add rows that exist in no other
  state, and 320px is where they run out of room. They are toured as their own
  entries rather than trusted because the screen underneath them measured fine.
- **The one absolute-width check: no fixed-format control squashed below its own
  widget.** Everything else in the sweep is relative, so a control can sit inside
  its container, overlap nothing, clip nothing, and still be too narrow to read.
  Scoped to `date`/`time`/`number` inputs and `select` — controls whose content
  **cannot be scrolled to**. A text field holding more than fits is ordinary and
  flagging it would fire on every long email address in the app, which is how a
  check gets deleted.

  **Measured against the control's own min-content width, by cloning it.** The
  obvious signal, `scrollWidth > clientWidth`, does not work and shipped an inert
  check for one run: Chromium draws a date input's widget in a UA shadow root
  with `overflow: hidden`, so a date field crushed from 166px to 38px reports
  `scrollWidth === clientWidth` and looks healthy. It *does* work for `select`,
  which is exactly enough plausibility to survive review. Min-content
  discriminates for both — 0px when healthy, 128px short for that same field.
- **The requested width is asserted, not assumed.** Every other check measures
  the DOM against the DOM, which makes them internally consistent and silent
  about *which* width they ran at — so a viewport option that failed to apply
  would leave all 608 checks green, every screenshot mislabelled, and the
  five-width claim hollow. One check per context, before the tour, naming both
  `documentElement.clientWidth` and `window.innerWidth` if they diverge. It is
  the file's own headline rule (a tour that cannot fail is a screenshot
  generator) applied to the tour's premise rather than to its steps.
- **Every screen is measured twice — at the top and scrolled to the end.**
  Overlap is judged on what is visible, so a check that only ever looks at the
  top of a page cannot see the bottom of a fourteen-row roster.
- **Every locator says `.filter({ visible: true })`, and `.first()`/`.last()` are
  not a substitute.** The stack keeps the screen underneath MOUNTED but hidden,
  so a locator that does not say "visible" can resolve to a node on that screen —
  one that will never become clickable. Playwright then retries for its whole
  timeout against an element that cannot change, and the run dies at a step with
  nothing wrong with it. `.first()`/`.last()` mean document order, not "the one
  on screen". `getByRole` happens to be immune because role selectors skip
  `display:none` subtrees the way a screen reader does; `getByTestId` is a plain
  CSS attribute selector and is **not**. Diagnosed in the sibling time-tracker's
  flow suite, at clean HEAD, failing about one run in two. **`web-e2e.mjs` still
  carries this shape** — its `tap()` and `sawText()` helpers (lines 152–159) take
  no visible filter; see the note under "The e2e harness" above.
- **The header Back is an `<a>`, not a `<button>`.** `PlatformPressable` renders
  `role="link"` when it has an `href`, and the navigator gives it one because
  this app has a linking config. A query for buttons alone reports every pushed
  screen as a dead end — a check failing on its own selector rather than on the
  app.
- **Seeding creates students WITHOUT a password, then sets one.** A `password`
  provider *at creation* is what `onUserCreate` reads as a client-side sign-up,
  and it deletes the account — so passing `password` to `createUser` silently
  deletes every student moments after making them. `createStudent` makes a
  password-less account for exactly this reason.
- **The content column is measured against `clientWidth`, not the bounding rect
  — a choice of property, not a guard.** `clientWidth` and
  `getBoundingClientRect().width` cost the same to write, and the layout box is
  simply what a layout question is about; do not "simplify" it away. Measured
  2026-08-27: this headless Chromium uses OVERLAY scrollbars, inset **zero**, in
  both scrollbar modes (`--disable-features=OverlayScrollbar` does not flip it —
  don't burn time trying), so the naive form would pass identically here. Where a
  classic scrollbar IS in effect the two checks fail in opposite directions:
  centring gets a false positive, the sideways-bleed check a false NEGATIVE
  hiding up to ~15px of real overflow. The false negative is the one that
  matters, because it degrades quietly instead of going red.
- **Targets under 44px are printed, never failed.** Informational: this app has
  legitimate sub-44px controls (chips, tab pills), and a check that cries wolf
  gets deleted.
- **There is deliberately no "is any text truncated" check.** It fires on every
  intentional `numberOfLines` clamp and would drown the real signal.

**Port lookups in these scripts use `ss`, never `lsof`.** `lsof` is not on the
default non-interactive PATH on this box, and a lookup that silences stderr then
reports "no listener" for a missing binary — which silently disables both the
stale-server kill and the cleanup trap. `free-emulator-ports.sh` set the
convention; follow it.

**Do not `exec` the emulator command, and do not add `INT TERM` to the trap.**
`exec` replaces the shell so the EXIT trap never runs (that leaked a dev server
on every run for a while, invisibly). And bash defers a *trapped* signal until
the foreground command returns, so trapping TERM around a minutes-long command
delays cleanup rather than ensuring it — measured at 406ms vs 2056ms. Node is the
opposite case; there, explicit handlers are the fix.

**A harness nobody has watched fail is not yet evidence.** The way this one was
proven, and the way to re-prove it after changing what it checks: add
`minWidth: 420` to the shared `card` style in `app/src/components/ui.tsx`, run
`SWEEP_WIDTHS=320 npm run test:screens`, and confirm it goes red naming the
screens and the exact controls carried past the right edge — 94/123 on
2026-08-27, across all three tours — then revert.

## Rules tests: the trap in the test itself

`assertFails` passes when an operation fails for **any** reason — including a
broken connection or a typo'd path. A deny-all suite can therefore pass while
testing nothing at all.

So whenever the rules change shape, **mutation-test the suite**: flip the rule to
`allow read, write: if true`, confirm the tests go red, and flip it back. Done
for Phase 0's baseline and again for every predicate added in Phase 1 (see
`PHASE_STATUS.md`), and it is the only thing that makes a suite of denials
meaningful.

**Assert the query the APP sends, not the one the rule was written for.** These
are not the same test, and the gap is invisible from either side. The ledger
rules were covered by `where('courseId','==',…)` on every collection — the shape
they were designed around — while `useRecordingLedger` sent `where('recordingId',
'==',…)`. Every one of its four listeners was denied for every manager, on every
recording, and `rules.ledger.test.ts` stayed green because it was asserting the
author's intent. Copy the query out of the hook, or the suite proves the rule
rather than the product.

Three specifics worth keeping in mind when editing `firestore.rules`:

- **A `list` rule that does not reference `resource.data` grants everything.**
  Referencing it is what forces the client's query to be constrained; a comment
  describing the expected query shape enforces nothing.
- **A `list` is judged on the query's CONSTRAINTS, not only on what it returns.**
  Whatever a rule's `get()` path is built from, the query must pin — otherwise
  the path cannot be resolved and the listen is refused. The tell is that it
  fails **with an empty result set too**: a query matching nothing is still
  denied, so the failure is total rather than data-dependent, and no amount of
  seeding will surface it if the shape is wrong. Test both, as
  `rules.ledger.test.ts` now does.
- **A `get()` resolved from document data costs one read per row** unless every
  row resolves the same path, in which case the result is cached and the query
  costs one (verified at 30 rows against the real engine). Firestore caps
  document-access calls per query, so keep such an arm behind a role guard that
  excludes any population whose queries span many parents, and size the test past
  the limit — `rules.structure.test.ts` uses 25 rows because at three it passes
  either way.

**An admin's run is not evidence about a manager's.** Every staff arm in this
app answers an admin from a zero-read branch that depends on no `resource.data`,
and a manager by resolving a course from the row. Only the second can fail
closed, so a screen exercised only as an admin is a screen whose rules are
untested — and the person who owns the app is the one who will never see the
failure. Both browser suites carry a manager's pass over the recording ledger
for exactly this reason.

Reading Firestore out of band (as the e2e does) needs
`Authorization: Bearer owner`; without it the rules apply and the read is
denied. Note the two different URL shapes: reads use
`/v1/projects/.../documents/...`, while the wipe endpoint is
`/emulator/v1/projects/.../documents`.

## Android

- AVD `tb_emu` (Pixel 6, API 35, Google APIs image) is shared with the sibling
  projects. Override with `SR_AVD`.
- Firebase emulators are reachable from the AVD at `10.0.2.2`; from web use the
  literal `127.0.0.1`, never `localhost` (the emulators bind IPv4 only, and
  `localhost` can resolve to `::1` first — which surfaces as a CORS error,
  because a failed connect produces no response to carry headers).
- **`EXPO_PUBLIC_*` in a debug build comes from the environment that started
  METRO**, not from the APK. If a flag looks unset on device, restart Metro with
  `--clear` and the variable set.
- **`BUILD SUCCESSFUL` is not proof the APK installed.** Confirm before trusting
  any screenshot:

  ```bash
  adb shell dumpsys package com.sabeelinstitute.classrecordings | grep versionName
  ```

  It must match `version` in `app/app.json`.

### Driving the app by adb (headless verification)

There is no device — the AVD `tb_emu` is a Pixel 6 at **1080×2400**. When a
screenshot is read back it is displayed at 900×2000, so **multiply the
coordinates you read off the image by 1.2** to get the real `adb shell input tap
X Y` target. Sign in headlessly with the emulator dev row
(`dev-signin-first-admin`), then `curl` the emulator's `bootstrapAdmin` to
promote (409 = already an admin, fine).

- **A pure-JS change needs a reload, not a rebuild.** After editing only JS,
  Metro fast-refreshes, but to be sure the running app has the new bundle,
  `adb shell am force-stop <pkg>` then relaunch — it refetches from Metro. Only a
  new *native* module (a new dependency) needs `expo run:android` again.
- **Uploads go through the Android SAF picker**, not the app. `adb push` a file
  to `/sdcard/Download`, tap the app's file button, then in the system picker:
  hamburger → Downloads → the file. The picker OPENING at all is already proof
  the native picker module is wired.
- The `Open debugger to view warnings` toast is dev-only LogBox noise; check
  `adb logcat -d | grep -i deprecated` for the actual warning rather than trusting
  the toast — and it never appears in a release build.

## Verifying the dev sign-in row is not shippable

`app/src/auth/devSignIn.ts` is gated on `IS_DEV && USE_EMULATORS` — two
independent conditions, because either alone could be got wrong (a release build
carrying a stale emulator env, or a dev build pointed at production).

**Do not verify this by grepping the exported bundle.** The strings survive
minification: the `DevRow` component is still referenced from a branch the
minifier cannot prove dead, so `grep "Emulator sign-in" app/dist-web/` finds it
in a perfectly safe build. That check produces a false alarm and teaches you to
ignore it.

Verify what actually matters — that it does not **render**:

```bash
npm run web:export -w @sabeel/app     # no EXPO_PUBLIC_USE_EMULATORS set
npx serve -s app/dist-web -l 4601
# then load it and assert the row is absent from the DOM
```

Confirmed absent on 2026-07-21 against a production export.
