# Phase status

Live build status. Phases from `PLAN.md`; a commit lands at each phase boundary.

Nine phases, not ten: Phase 2 was absorbed into Phase 1. The later numbers are
deliberately NOT renumbered — they are referenced from `PLAN.md`, code comments
and commit messages, and renaming them would strand every one of those.

| Phase | What | Status |

| 0 | Scaffold, theme, CI green | **complete** (2026-07-21: token screen verified on tb_emu AVD + web export, rules suite mutation-tested, full chain green) |
| 1a | Identity: two auth populations, roles, approval | **complete** (2026-07-21) |
| 1b | Academic structure: cohorts, classes, enrollments, manager scoping | **complete** (2026-07-22) |
| 1c | Rules hardening, e2e harness | **complete** (2026-07-22) |
| ~~2~~ | *Academic structure — absorbed into Phase 1, see the decision log* | — |

## Decision log

- 2026-07-22 — **Institute timezone is `America/Chicago`** (Houston, TX). Due
  dates are date-only, so "overdue" is decided entirely by where the day rolls
  over; this is ONE institute-wide constant, not per-student. Recorded here
  rather than added to `@sabeel/shared` today, because this repo adds
  infrastructure with its first consumer and knip fails on anything unused — it
  lands in Phase 4 alongside the code that reads it.

- 2026-07-22 — **GCS returns 400 on an expired signed URL, not 403.** The body is
  `<Code>ExpiredToken</Code>`. Any refresh logic keyed on 403 would silently
  never fire, so URLs are re-minted PROACTIVELY when under an hour remains
  rather than in response to a failure.

- 2026-07-22 — **The emulator playback URL needs a download token.** A plain
  `?alt=media` URL is rules-governed, and `storage.rules` denies all reads by
  design — production playback bypasses rules by being signed. The emulator
  branch therefore uses the one other mechanism that bypasses them: a download
  token. That is precisely the never-expiring mechanism rejected for production,
  and it is acceptable only because that branch cannot run against a real
  project.

- 2026-07-22 — **`listeningProgress` is the only client-written collection.** A
  callable every 15 seconds per listening student is pure overhead, and listened
  time is audit evidence rather than the gate — completion is student-attested
  and blocked only if they never played. The rule is self-only and field-scoped.
  Note the null guard: `resource` is null when the document does not exist,
  which is the first-time resume path, and dereferencing it is an evaluation
  ERROR rather than a denial — it surfaced as a broken player.

- 2026-07-22 — **The emulator Storage bucket needs an explicit constant.**
  Neither side has a usable default: the client's `firebaseConfig.storageBucket`
  is a placeholder until the real project exists, and the Admin SDK throws
  "Bucket name not specified" without one. Overriding only `projectId` for the
  emulator left the client uploading to one bucket while the server looked in
  another — and the only symptom was finalize reporting "no audio found" for a
  file that had uploaded successfully. `EMULATOR_STORAGE_BUCKET` in
  `@sabeel/shared` is now used by the app, the functions and the tests. The
  integration suite had hidden the mismatch by hardcoding its own bucket name.

- 2026-07-22 — **Recording audio is write-once in Storage.** `resource == null`
  in `storage.rules` means a published recording's audio can never be swapped
  underneath students who already listened. Replacing it goes through
  `clearRecordingAudio`, which refuses unless the recording is a draft. Storage
  rules cannot read Firestore, so class scope is enforced in `createRecording`
  (before the id is handed out) and again at publish; the rule can only ask "is
  this active staff".

- 2026-07-22 — **Uploading is web-only for now** (`filePicker.ts` seam). It needs
  a document-picker native module, and the brief describes upload as the staff
  exception path done from the recording library. Android explains this rather
  than showing a control that cannot work.

- 2026-07-22 — **`expo-audio` config had to be made explicit**, found by the 3a
  spike. Config plugins only run during `prebuild`, and this is the bare workflow
  with a committed `android/`, so adding the plugin to `app.json` silently added
  nothing: no `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`, no media service, no notification permission.
  Background audio still *worked* on the emulator without them, which is exactly
  how this would have shipped broken. `npx expo prebuild --platform android`
  regenerates the manifest; `recordAudioAndroid: false` keeps the plugin from
  requesting a microphone this app never uses; `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` is requested
  explicitly because the plugin only adds it for background *recording*, not
  playback. Generalised into the `expo-firebase-stack` skill (`9bef5a0`).

- 2026-07-22 — **Offline downloads deferred out of Phase 3** into their own
  phase. The brief calls them optional while streaming is required, and Phase 3
  is the highest-risk phase already.

- 2026-07-22 — **`listeningProgress` moved from Phase 4 into Phase 3.** "Resume
  progress" is a Phase 3 playback requirement and is meaningless without
  persistence; building it locally now and again in Firestore later is waste.
  Phase 4 keeps assignments, completion and the ledger — accountability, not
  playback.

- 2026-07-22 — **`list` rules must reference `resource.data`.** The first draft
  of the enrollments rule was `isAdmin() || isStudent() || isStaff()` with a
  comment saying students would constrain their query — which would have let any
  student list every enrollment in the institute. Referencing `resource.data` is
  what makes Firestore reject an unconstrained query; a comment enforces nothing.

- 2026-07-22 — **A `get()` resolved from document data costs one read per row.**
  Firestore caps document-access calls per query, so such an arm is only
  affordable when every row resolves the same path — true of a roster query
  (`classId ==`), false of anything spanning classes. Each read-requiring arm is
  therefore kept behind a role guard that excludes populations whose queries span
  many parents. `rules.structure.test.ts` sizes both cases at 25 rows, because at
  three they pass either way.

- 2026-07-22 — **Arm ordering is NOT what protects the student query.** An
  earlier comment claimed it was. Reordering the arms and re-running the scale
  tests proved otherwise: `isStaff() &&` short-circuits before the `get()`, so a
  student never triggers a class read whatever the order. Read-free arms are
  still written first as defence in depth, but the guard is what holds.

- 2026-07-22 — **`effectiveActive` is computed inside the callables**, not by a
  Firestore trigger. Clients cannot write these collections at all, so there is
  nothing for a trigger to defend against; inline means no propagation lag and
  one testable path. The cohort cascade never writes a class's own `archived`
  flag, which is what makes reactivation restore each class to its prior state.

- 2026-07-22 — **Unenrolling sets `active: false`; it never deletes.** The brief
  requires listening history to survive across enrollments, and a hard delete
  removes the record that history hangs off. Re-enrolling reuses the same
  composite-id document and preserves the original enrolment date.

- 2026-07-22 — **`managerClassScopes` dropped; `managerUids` lives on the class.**
  Recorded in the plan and implemented here. `setClassManagers` validates every
  uid is an *active* staff member, because the rules read that array directly —
  writing an invented or disabled uid into it is granting access.

- 2026-07-22 — **Class mutation is admin-only.** The brief gives admins
  "manage cohorts/classes globally" and "assign Managers class by class", while
  managers get "create/manage students in assigned classes". So there is no
  manager-write case on a class; managers get scoped read plus the roster.

- 2026-07-22 — **The student directory is readable by all staff** (Faisal). A
  manager can list every student, not only those in their classes — that is what
  makes enrolling an existing student possible. Every student mutation is still
  scoped or admin-only. A deliberate privacy call, noted in `firestore.rules` so
  it is not later read as an oversight and "fixed".

- 2026-07-21 — **Phases 1 and 2 merged.** Manager scopes are class-by-class and
  student quick-create takes an enrolled class, so splitting them would mean
  writing the security rules twice — once in a shape that cannot be enforced,
  then again against real classes. Nine phases, not ten.

- 2026-07-21 — **`managerClassScopes` dropped in favour of `managerUids` on the
  class document.** A rule that depends on a cross-document `get()` forces every
  listing client to carry a matching `where` clause and costs a read per row; a
  denormalised array supports `array-contains` instead. Same reasoning puts
  enrollments at a composite id `{studentUid}_{classId}`, so a student lists
  their own enrollments and never lists classes. The brief's data model states it
  "is not the final schema"; this is a sanctioned consolidation.

- 2026-07-21 — **`role` is one claim** (`admin` | `manager` | `student`), kanban's
  shape rather than the time-tracker's role + separate `admin` boolean. Nobody
  here is a manager *and* separately an admin, so one field cannot get into an
  inconsistent pair.

- 2026-07-21 — **Students arrive active, with no pending state.** Staff creating
  them is the approval. No separate email verification either: completing the
  set-password link proves mailbox control, and the address was asserted by
  staff.

- 2026-07-21 — **App identity**: `com.sabeelinstitute.classrecordings`, slug
  `sabeel-class-recordings`, launcher label "Class Recordings". The brief's
  product name (*Hikam Foundations Class Recordings*) is too long for a launcher
  and bakes one course into the identifier.

- 2026-07-21 — **Phase 0 runs entirely on emulators.** `firebase-config.ts` ships
  placeholders and `.firebaserc` is unset, so nothing before Phase 6 blocks on
  Faisal. The real project is created when Phase 1 first needs a real sign-in.

- 2026-07-21 — **Playback is a 12-hour V4 signed URL** minted by a callable that
  has already checked enrollment, with App Check enforced on it. Faisal's threat
  model: a leaked link must *expire*, but a determined user extracting audio from
  their own device is acceptable. That rules out `getDownloadURL()`, whose
  download token never expires. It does **not** require download-then-play, so
  progressive streaming, instant start and free seeking all stay. Audio is never
  proxied through a Function — the 60-minute timeout would kill a 2-hour session.

- 2026-07-21 — **Zoom import deferred to Phase 6**, against the risk register's
  "prove Zoom first". Zoom credentials are a pending external input, and manual
  upload exercises the whole media pipeline anyway.

- 2026-07-21 — **Infrastructure arrives with its first consumer.** `liveQuery.ts`,
  Firestore/Storage/Auth initialisation and navigation were all deferred out of
  Phase 0 because nothing consumed them, and `knip` correctly called them dead.
  Scaffolding ahead of need makes the dead-code audit lie, and an audit that
  reports nothing is worse than none.

## Verification log

- 2026-07-22 — **Phase 4a: Firestore persistence seam.** `app/src/firestoreInit.ts`
  / `.web.ts` mirror the existing auth seam: web gets `persistentLocalCache`
  (IndexedDB) so offline writes survive a page close and surface as
  `hasPendingWrites`; native keeps the memory cache, because the JS SDK has no
  IndexedDB on React Native (the same reason auth is wired to AsyncStorage). Full
  e2e re-run green with persistence on, including the Phase 3 resume-across-reload
  test. **Deliberately split from the plan's 4a:** the native app-kill durability
  check needs the completion write path to exist, so it moves to 4c on the AVD,
  where the memory-cache gap is closed by an AsyncStorage backstop over the same
  direct-write path if the test confirms it is lost across a kill.

- 2026-07-22 — **Phase 3 proven end to end against the REAL project.** Driven
  through the actual callables with real ID tokens: createCohort → createClass →
  createStudent+enrollment → createRecording → upload through the Storage REST
  API with a staff token (so `storage.rules` was genuinely exercised, not
  bypassed by the Admin SDK) → finalize read back the exact 509,121 bytes →
  publish → a student signed in, `getPlaybackUrl` returned a **real V4 signed
  URL** (`X-Goog-Signature` present, ~12 h), it streamed the exact file, range
  requests answered 206, a second upload was refused 403 (write-once), and a
  NON-enrolled student was refused playback. All temporary data and accounts
  deleted afterwards; the walkthrough script is deliberately NOT committed,
  because it mints an account with admin claims and a known password.
- 2026-07-22 — **`createStudent` rejected the very first student**, before any
  class existed, with "classId must be a class id." The callable client
  serializes an explicitly-`undefined` property as **null**, so the UI's
  `classId: classId ?? undefined` arrived as `classId: null` and a guard testing
  only `!== undefined` treated it as a bad value. Fixed on both sides (server
  treats null as absent; client omits the key) and verified in production with
  the exact failing payload. The walkthrough above had missed it by always
  passing a classId — a reminder that a happy-path script is not coverage.

- 2026-07-22 — **`firestore.indexes.json` was EMPTY, and no test could have told
  us.** The Staff and Students screens both showed
  `Live data error (decidedStaff): failed-precondition` on the first real use.
  The Firestore **emulator builds indexes on demand and never returns
  FAILED_PRECONDITION**, so all 119 emulator tests and every e2e check passed
  against an index file containing nothing at all. Four composite indexes were
  needed (staffUsers status+createdAt, staffUsers status+displayName, classes
  cohortId+createdAt, recordings classId+createdAt) and are now deployed.
  `npm run check:queries` (new, committed) runs all twelve query shapes the app
  issues against the REAL project and fails on any that needs a missing index —
  the only check that can catch this, since shape rather than data determines it.
  Note the two staffUsers indexes reported "currently building" for ~2 minutes
  AFTER `gcloud` reported them READY.

- 2026-07-22 — **First admin bootstrapped in production, and the endpoint
  removed.** `onUserCreate` provisioned the real Google sign-in as
  `role: manager, status: pending` — domain membership granting nothing, as
  designed. `bootstrapAdmin` then promoted it to `admin/active`, refused a replay
  with 409, and was deleted (URL 404s).
  It is now exported ONLY against the demo project: it cannot be deleted from the
  repo because the e2e uses it for the same bootstrap problem in miniature, and
  leaving it in the export list would silently recreate an unauthenticated
  admin-granting endpoint on the next deploy. Verified by loading the built
  bundle under each project id — 17 functions and ABSENT for the real project,
  18 and PRESENT for demo — and then by a full `deploy --only functions` that
  left the URL 404ing.
- 2026-07-22 — **The first-admin address was duplicated and drifted.** The
  callable hardcoded a guessed local part while the dev sign-in row hardcoded
  another; correcting the callable to the real address made the e2e bootstrap a
  user the callable would not promote, and it failed at the first authenticated
  screen. Now one `FIRST_ADMIN_EMAIL` in `@sabeel/shared`, consumed by both.

- 2026-07-22 — **Self-signup is deleted by the trigger, proven in both
  directions.** The first version of this e2e check was VACUOUS: it polled the
  Auth emulator's `/emulator/v1/projects/*/accounts` endpoint, which is
  DELETE-only, so the GET returned `Method GET not allowed`, `userInfo` was
  undefined and the check passed unconditionally. It survived a deliberate
  mutation of the very rule it protects, which is the only reason it was caught.
  Rewritten to assert on *using* the credential — mutation in place: FAIL
  ("sign-in still succeeded"); mutation removed: ok (`EMAIL_NOT_FOUND`).
- 2026-07-22 — **`disabledUserSignup` is unusable, discovered on the first real
  sign-in.** Google sign-in returned `auth/admin-restricted-operation`; the live
  project showed **0 users** and `onUserCreate` had **0 log entries**, so the
  block happens before the trigger. Creating a staff member's account IS a
  sign-up, so that console setting and staff self-onboarding are mutually
  exclusive. The guard moved into `provision.ts`, which can distinguish the two
  populations: a real student has NO provider at creation (created without a
  password), so a `password` provider at creation can only be a client sign-up.

- 2026-07-22 — **First production deploy: rules, indexes, 18 functions, Hosting.**
  The Firestore database did not exist and was created by the rules deploy.
  `npm run smoke:prod` (new, committed) then verified the *deployed* artefact
  rather than the local one, which is the only place these can be checked:
  Hosting serves `/__/auth/handler` (200), the bundle contacts **no** emulator
  host, the dev sign-in row does not render, and the console is clean. Auth
  config read back from the live Identity Toolkit API:
  `disabledUserSignup: true`, email/password on, email-link off, anonymous off,
  `authorizedDomains` covering both hosting domains. `authDomain` flipped to
  `…web.app` and `WEB_CLIENT_ID` filled in from the created OAuth client.
  **`onUserCreate` domain enforcement is now live** — before this deploy it
  existed only in the repo, so a stray Google sign-in would have persisted.
- 2026-07-22 — **Signing proven against the real project**, which no emulator
  test can do. A V4 URL signed by the compute service account streamed the exact
  3,049,585 bytes, answered a range request with 206, and a deliberately
  10-second URL was then refused with `ExpiredToken`. The probe function and its
  object were deleted immediately after.
- 2026-07-22 — **Phase 3c end to end.** The committed e2e now covers upload →
  publish → a student playing: audio advances (0:06 after six seconds), progress
  is persisted, and playback **resumes at 0:36 after a reload**. 119 emulator
  tests. Three mutations on the progress rules; the third initially caught
  nothing, which exposed a missing list-coverage test — now added and verified
  to fail under the same mutation.

- 2026-07-22 — **Phase 3b end to end on the web dev server.** A real 12-minute
  32 kbps M4A uploaded through the UI: duration 720 s read client-side, size
  3,049,585 bytes read server-side from Storage (matching the file), then
  published with `publishedAt` stamped. 111 emulator tests. Five rule mutations
  each caught by the right tests: recordings' student `published` check, its
  enrolment check, its staff `managerUids` check, Storage write-once, and
  Storage staff-only upload.

- 2026-07-22 — **Phase 3a spike, on the AVD.** `expo-audio` background playback
  survives backgrounding and 60 s of screen-off (position advanced 0:00 → 1:57,
  matching wall-clock); a media3 `MediaSession` registers and media transport
  controls appear in the shade; seek to 10:00 into a 12-minute file works over
  HTTP range requests (6 GETs observed); 2x playback rate applies with no
  buffering stall; duration is read correctly from a remote URL. Signed-URL
  streaming is the one spike item still unproven — it needs the real project.
  Spike code deleted; the `app.json` and manifest fixes it produced are kept.

- 2026-07-22 — **Phase 1b/1c verified end to end.** `npm run test:e2e` (new,
  committed) drives 17 checks on the web dev server: pending on first sign-in,
  live un-gating via bootstrap and via admin approval, off-domain deletion,
  cohort and class creation, manager scoping, student created-and-enrolled in one
  step, roster, set-password link redeemed and used to sign in, and the full
  archive cascade round-trip read back from Firestore. Android parity confirmed
  on the `tb_emu` AVD (`versionName=0.1.0` confirmed installed).
- 2026-07-22 — **Six rule mutations, each caught by the right tests.** Class
  manager-scoping removed; enrollment student arm widened; enrollment staff arm
  widened; the student class-read enrolment check dropped; cohorts opened to any
  signed-in user; enrollments made client-writable. Restored and green after each.
- 2026-07-22 — **The e2e harness was itself mutation-tested, and a gap found.**
  Widening the manager-scope rule did NOT fail the e2e, because `useMyClasses`
  filters via `array-contains` in the query — the check was testing the query,
  not the boundary. The check names were corrected to say what they actually
  prove, and the harness header now states it is a flow suite, not a security
  suite. A check whose name overstates its coverage makes a suite look stronger
  than it is.

- 2026-07-21 — **Phase 1a, end to end on both surfaces.** First staff sign-in
  lands pending; `bootstrapAdmin` promotes and the gate lifts **live with no
  sign-out**; a second call to it 409s; an admin approves a pending manager and
  *their* gate lifts live; an off-domain sign-in has its auth user deleted and
  lands back at sign-in; a student is created, sets a password from the emulator's
  emailed link, and signs in. Verified on the web dev server and on the `tb_emu`
  AVD (`versionName=0.1.0` confirmed installed).
- 2026-07-21 — **Identity rules mutation-tested, three ways.** `isActive()`
  ignoring status → the pending and disabled tests went red. `isStaff()` widened
  to any active user → the student-isolation tests went red. `staffUsers` given a
  self-write → the no-write test went red. Restored and green each time.
- 2026-07-21 — **Dev sign-in row confirmed absent from a production render.**
  Note that grepping the exported bundle is NOT a valid check: the strings
  survive minification because the component is still referenced from a branch
  the minifier cannot prove dead. See `docs/DEV-TOOLING.md`.

- 2026-07-21 — **Rules suite mutation-tested.** `assertFails` passes when an
  operation fails for *any* reason, so a deny-all suite can pass while testing
  nothing. Flipped both `firestore.rules` and `storage.rules` to
  `allow read, write: if true`; all 6 tests went red; restored and they went
  green. The suite genuinely exercises both rule files.
- 2026-07-21 — **knip proven to fail.** Added a throwaway unused export, knip
  exited 1; removed it, knip exited 0. The CI step is not decorative.
- 2026-07-21 — **esbuild bundling verified.** `@sabeel/shared` is inlined into
  `functions/lib/index.js` (zero `require("@sabeel/shared")`) while
  `firebase-functions` stays external — the shape Cloud Build needs.
