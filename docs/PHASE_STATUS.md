# Phase status

Live build status. Phases from `PLAN.md`; a commit lands at each phase boundary.

| Phase | What | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Scaffold, theme, CI green | **complete** (2026-07-21: token screen verified on tb_emu AVD + web export, rules suite mutation-tested, full chain green) |
| 1 | Identity & authorization (staff Google + student email/password, class scopes) | not started |
| 2 | Academic structure (cohorts, classes, enrollments) | not started |
| 3 | Media spine (upload → Storage → signed-URL playback → offline downloads) | not started |
| 4 | Assignments, progress, completion | not started |
| 5 | Staff ledger, reporting, audit | not started |
| 6 | Zoom import *(gated on credentials)* | not started |
| 7 | Notifications | not started |
| 8 | Admin backend stats | not started |
| 9 | Deploy, manual, release | not started |

## Decision log

- 2026-07-21 — **App identity**: `com.sabeelinstitute.classrecordings`, slug
  `sabeel-class-recordings`, launcher label "Class Recordings". The brief's
  product name (*Hikam Foundations Class Recordings*) is too long for a launcher
  and bakes one course into the identifier.

- 2026-07-21 — **Phase 0 runs entirely on emulators.** `firebase-config.ts` ships
  placeholders and `.firebaserc` is unset, so nothing before Phase 6 blocks on
  Faisal. The real project is created when Phase 1 first needs a real sign-in.

- 2026-07-21 — **Playback is a 12-hour V4 signed URL** minted by a callable that
  has already checked enrollment, with App Check enforced on it. Faisal's threat
  model: a leaked link must *expire*, but a determined user extracting audio from
  their own device is acceptable. That rules out `getDownloadURL()`, whose
  download token never expires. It does **not** require download-then-play, so
  progressive streaming, instant start and free seeking all stay. Audio is never
  proxied through a Function — the 60-minute timeout would kill a 2-hour session.

- 2026-07-21 — **Zoom import deferred to Phase 6**, against the risk register's
  "prove Zoom first". Zoom credentials are a pending external input, and manual
  upload exercises the whole media pipeline anyway.

- 2026-07-21 — **Infrastructure arrives with its first consumer.** `liveQuery.ts`,
  Firestore/Storage/Auth initialisation and navigation were all deferred out of
  Phase 0 because nothing consumed them, and `knip` correctly called them dead.
  Scaffolding ahead of need makes the dead-code audit lie, and an audit that
  reports nothing is worse than none.

## Verification log

- 2026-07-21 — **Rules suite mutation-tested.** `assertFails` passes when an
  operation fails for *any* reason, so a deny-all suite can pass while testing
  nothing. Flipped both `firestore.rules` and `storage.rules` to
  `allow read, write: if true`; all 6 tests went red; restored and they went
  green. The suite genuinely exercises both rule files.
- 2026-07-21 — **knip proven to fail.** Added a throwaway unused export, knip
  exited 1; removed it, knip exited 0. The CI step is not decorative.
- 2026-07-21 — **esbuild bundling verified.** `@sabeel/shared` is inlined into
  `functions/lib/index.js` (zero `require("@sabeel/shared")`) while
  `firebase-functions` stays external — the shape Cloud Build needs.
